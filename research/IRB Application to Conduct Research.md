Appendix C
Touro University Worldwide Ethical Principles Form

Touro University Worldwide Ethical Principles & Guidelines for Research Involving Human Subjects
(Adapted from The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects
of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, April 18, 1979)
The ethical codes for conducting research consist of rules, some general, others specific, that guide the investigators or the reviewers of research in their work. Such rules often are inadequate to cover complex situations; at times they come into conflict, and they are frequently difficult to interpret or apply. Broader ethical principles will provide a basis on which specific rules may be formulated, criticized and interpreted.
1.	Informed Consent. -- Respect for persons requires that subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them. This opportunity is provided when adequate standards for informed consent are satisfied.
(Researcher Initial____FC_______, Date______10/29/2025_________)
2.	Comprehension. The manner and context in which information is conveyed is as important as the information itself. For example, presenting information in a disorganized and rapid fashion, allowing too little time for consideration or curtailing opportunities for questioning, all may adversely affect a subject's ability to make an informed choice.
(Researcher Initial____FC_______, Date______10/29/2025_________)
3.	Voluntariness. An agreement to participate in research constitutes a valid consent only if voluntarily given. This element of informed consent requires conditions free of coercion and undue influence. Coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Undue influence, by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive, unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance. Also, inducements that would ordinarily be acceptable may become undue influences if the subject is especially vulnerable.
(Researcher Initial____FC_______, Date______10/29/2025_________)

4.	Assessment of Risks and Benefits: The assessment of risks and benefits requires a careful review of relevant data, including, in some cases, alternative ways of obtaining the benefits sought in the research. Thus, the assessment presents both an opportunity and a responsibility to gather systematic and comprehensive information about proposed research. For the researcher, it is a means to examine whether the proposed research is properly designed. For a review committee, it is a method for determining whether the risks that will be presented to subjects are justified. For prospective subjects, the assessment will assist the determination whether or not to participate.
(Researcher Initial____FC_______, Date______10/29/2025_________)
5.	Justice is relevant to the selection of subjects of research at two levels: the social and the individual. Individual justice in the selection of subjects would require that researchers exhibit fairness: thus, they should not offer potentially beneficial research only to some patients who are in their favor or select only "undesirable" persons for risky research.
(Researcher Initial____FC_______, Date______10/29/2025_________)
6.	Social justice requires that distinction be drawn between classes of subjects that ought, and ought not, to participate in any particular kind of research, based on the ability of members of that class to bear burdens and on the appropriateness of placing further burdens on already burdened persons. Thus, it can be considered a matter of social justice that there is an order of preference in the selection of classes of subjects (e.g., adults before children) and that some classes of potential subjects (e.g., the institutionalized mentally infirm or prisoners) may be involved as research subjects, if at all, only on certain conditions.
(Researcher Initial____FC_______, Date______10/29/2025_________)

I have read and understood all the ethical codes for conducting research. Furthermore, I will follow the guidelines outlined by the Institutional Review Board to ensure that my research study complies with the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research
