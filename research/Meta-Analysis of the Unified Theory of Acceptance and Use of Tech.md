Abstract 
There are both formal and informal cries that UTAUT and, by association, the stream of research on 
technology adoption has reached its limit, with little or no opportunities for new knowledge creation. 
Such a conclusion is ironic because the theory has not been sufficiently and suitably replicated. It is 
possible that misspecifications in the various replications, applications, and extensions have led to 
the incorrect conclusion that UTAUT is more robust than it really is, leaving limited opportunities 
for future work. Although work on UTAUT has included important variables, predictors, and 
moderators, absent a faithful use of the original specification, it is impossible to assess the true nature 
of the effects of the original and additional variables. The present meta-analysis uses 25,619 effect 
sizes reported by 737,112 users in 1,935 independent samples to address this issue. Consequently, 
we develop a clear current state-of-the-art and revised UTAUT that extends the original theory with 
new endogenous mechanisms from different, other theories (i.e., technology compatibility, user 
education, personal innovativeness, and costs of technology) and new moderating mechanisms to 
examine the generalizability of UTAUT in different contexts (e.g., technology type and national 
culture). Based on this revised UTAUT, we present a research agenda that can guide future research 
on the topic of technology adoption in general and UTAUT in particular.

1 Introduction 
The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 
(UTAUT; Venkatesh et al., 2003) is one of the most 
widely cited theories in the information systems (IS) 
literature, with a reach that has extended well beyond the 
IS field and in a variety of settings and populations. The

paper. 
original model was developed to explain employee 
acceptance 1  and use of technology using four 
predictors—performance expectancy, effort expectancy, 
social influence, and facilitating conditions—and four 
moderators: gender, age, experience, and voluntariness. 
One key extension to UTAUT was by Venkatesh et al. 
(2012), who proposed UTAUT2 by contextualizing 
UTAUT to a consumer context, with the addition of three

predictors—hedonic motivation, price value, and 
habit—and 
dropping 
one 
of 
the 
moderators, 
voluntariness. The Google Scholar citation count of the 
original UTAUT paper is over 36,000 and the UTAUT2 
paper is over 9,000; the Web of Science citation counts 
for these two papers are over 12,000 and 3,000, 
respectively. Although by itself, it does not mean every 
citation is a replication or an effort to apply or extend 
UTAUT, the number of studies being conducted is 
tending toward the thousands (see Venkatesh et al., 
2016b). Given the large number of UTAUT studies, 
there are both formal and informal cries to suggest that 
UTAUT and perhaps by association the stream of 
research on technology adoption has reached its limit, 
with little or no new knowledge to be gained. Such 
maturity 
declarations 
notwithstanding, 
recently, 
Venkatesh et al. (2016b) lamented that most replications, 
applications, and extensions were not sufficiently 
inclusive of the original moderators and thus did not 
comprehensively 
examine 
UTAUT. 
Potentially 
addressing this gap were prior meta-analyses on UTAUT 
such as those by Dwivedi et al. (2019), Taiwo and 
Downe (2013), and Khechine et al. (2016). However, 
these meta-analyses rely on small databases covering 
few users, technologies, and cultures. Although Taiwo 
and Downe (2013) synthesized empirical results of 37 
studies, Khechine et al. (2016) used 74 studies, and 
Dwivedi et al. (2019) examined 162 studies, none of 
these meta-analyses examined the UTAUT2 extensions 
or any other variables used in the various extensions in 
the literature. Further, these meta-analyses have not only 
overlooked the moderators in UTAUT, but also other 
contextual and method characteristics that may explain 
differences across studies. Thus, there is an acute need to 
understand the robustness, completeness, and accuracy 
of the original specification.  
Given that UTAUT has not actually been sufficiently 
and suitably replicated—an issue that is of great 
importance to scientists (Dennis & Valacich, 2014; 
Tsang & Kwan, 1999)—we could have one of two 
serious problems. First, it is possible that the 
misspecifications 
in 
the 
various 
replications, 
applications, and extensions led to the incorrect 
conclusion that UTAUT is more robust than it really 
was and opportunities for future work are limited. 
Second, although the extensions have included 
important variables, predictors, and moderators from 
UTAUT and other theories, absent the original 
specification, it is impossible to assess the true nature 
of the effects of the original and additional variables in 
order to arrive at a new, more accurate, more complete 
UTAUT specification.  
We contend that the original UTAUT specification and 
UTAUT2, although useful for capturing important 
constructs explaining the acceptance and use of 
technology, still lack a broader coverage of relevant 
constructs. We observed that most of the existing 
papers that have applied UTAUT are in what is termed 
the red ocean, as they are mostly incremental 
contributions using nearly the same set or subset of 
constructs. In principle, we thus agree with the muted 
formal and vocal informal calls to cease and desist 
work using the theory, albeit in its original/current 
form. Such concerns were earlier raised about the 
predecessor 
to 
UTAUT, 
i.e., 
the 
technology 
acceptance model (for examples, see Bagozzi, 2007; 
Benbasat & Barki, 2007). Nonetheless, while 
acknowledging 
such 
concerns, 
future 
research 
directions on acceptance and use in general, with a 
particular focus on UTAUT and its derivative models, 
have also been proposed by a number of scholars in a 
variety of journals. These future research directions 
have been developed based on a qualitative review of 
the literature (Venkatesh et al., 2016b), meta-analysis 
(Dwivedi et al., 2019), and/or replication of UTAUT 
in different contexts (Al-Gahtani et al., 2007; 
Venkatesh & Zhang, 2010).  
Considering the number of research endeavors using 
UTAUT, it behooves us to take stock of the model 
specification to provide an accurate assessment of the 
robustness of theory and a clear, current, state-of-the-
art revised theory that can guide future endeavors on 
this topic. In order to understand what has been studied 
in the past, which theories and predictors hold the most 
promise, and how UTAUT studies can create new and 
substantial contributions, amidst the current number of 
UTAUT studies in the red ocean, we conducted a 
comprehensive meta-analysis on UTAUT. The meta-
analysis will lead us to an accurate specification of the 
theory spanning various contexts such as different user 
samples (age, gender, consumer/employee), national 
cultures (power distance, individualism-collectivism, 
masculinity-femininity, uncertainty avoidance), and 
technologies 
(mobile/non-mobile, 
online/offline, 
transaction/non-transaction). 
Our 
meta-analysis, 
including 
proposed 
predictors 
and 
moderators 
extracted from 1,935 independent samples that have 
applied UTAUT, will help us arrive at a current, 
accurate, and robust specification of UTAUT because, 
unlike previous meta-analyses on UTAUT, we will 
include all predictors and theories proposed in 
previous UTAUT studies, the original UTAUT by 
including the moderators, and examine the contextual 
application of UTAUT based on technology types, 
individual characteristics, and national culture. Armed 
with this specification, we propose key future research 
directions. We believe that our meta-analysis will help 
future researchers to seek out the blue ocean related to 
technology adoption in general and UTAUT in 
particular. As stated by Straub (2009), the blue ocean 
does not have to be entirely new research and we are 
not calling for a new theory to replace UTAUT. 
Instead, with this meta-analysis, we examine the 
theoretical boundaries of UTAUT and propose new 
territory (e.g., new four key variables and context of

UTAUT) that future research can examine and use to 
identify opportunities to conduct blue ocean research 
on/using UTAUT.  
While reiterating that we believe that fruitful questions 
related to technology acceptance and use do exist, we 
believe they will emerge from a new starting point—
i.e., a new theoretical specification that will emerge 
from this work—and rich contextualization (see 
Alvesson & Kärreman, 2007; Johns, 2006) that 
considers new, unique contexts such as rural 
environments (e.g., Venkatesh & Sykes, 2013, where 
traditional predictors of acceptance were found to be 
inadequate), cultural considerations (e.g., Al-Gahtani 
et al., 2007 and Venkatesh & Zhang, 2010, where 
traditional predictors were found to be inadequate in a 
new culture), technology type (e.g., Sykes & 
Venkatesh, 2017, where traditional predictors were 
inadequate in an ERP system context), and personality 
traits of users (e.g., Barnett et al., 2015, where 
personality traits were found to influence the 
acceptance of technology). 
2 Meta-Analysis 
Meta-analyses provide a systematic way to assess the 
progress of existing theories and serve as a theory 
extension tool (Carney et al., 2011; Orsingher et al., 
2016). Although in the past, meta-analyses have been 
considered to be conclusive and the definitive or final 
word on a given topic, that has since shifted because, 
more often than not, meta-analyses raise more questions 
than they answer and are thus now seen as a means of 
reinvigorating interest in mature research areas and 
encouraging the development of novel ideas (Shaw & 
Ertug, 2017). Since multiple studies on a single 
phenomenon will always provide more information 
about the phenomenon than any single study, meta-
analyses provide numerous benefits (McShane & 
Böckenholt, 2017).  
First, 
meta-analyses 
allow 
researchers 
to 
comprehensively collect the findings of individual 
studies and provide an overview of all the predictors 
found in a specific research topic. As is the case with 
UTAUT, where a majority of the studies have been 
carried out with relatively small sample sizes, their 
results could be unique to the examined sample. Meta-
analyses thus enable us to overcome this issue and come 
up with more robust effects (Sleesman et al., 2012). 
Second, meta-analyses explore relationships between a 
theoretical construct, its predictors, and/or outcomes, 
while correcting any distortion present in measurement 
errors, sampling errors, and other inputs that may lead 
to conflicting results (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004).  
Third, meta-analyses allow researchers to take 
advantage of the variation in the settings of the 
individual studies included in it and to quantify the 
moderating influence of the settings as boundary 
conditions for the examined relationships in the study 
(Geyskens 
et 
al., 
2009; 
Karna, 
Richter, 
& 
Riesenkampff, 2016). Testing the boundaries of 
theoretical models further aids researchers in confirming 
the predictive and explanatory power of theories and in 
advancing knowledge (Bergh et al., 2016).  
Fourth, meta-analyses (specifically, meta-analyses with 
SEM) enable researchers to conduct a “horse race” and 
examine the explanatory power of a theoretical model in 
comparison to other competing models. They also allow 
for testing intermediate mechanisms in relationships and 
examining mediation mechanisms regarding their 
existence, order, direction, and magnitude (Bergh et al., 
2016). By getting a better understanding of the 
relationships between constructs across many studies, 
researchers are better positioned to discover innovative 
problems and reflect on constructs and relationships that 
ultimately serve as the foundation for new theories 
(Aguinis et al., 2011; MacInnis, 2011).  
Finally, the uncertainty in a meta-analysis will typically 
be smaller than the uncertainty in the individual studies 
included in the meta-analysis, thus providing a solution 
in the case where individual studies provide conflicting 
results (McShane & Böckenholt, 2017). Meta-analysis 
can be and has been used to assess and revise various 
theories in different fields such as the technology 
acceptance model (King & He, 2006), IS success model 
(Petter & Mclean, 2009), theories of reasoned action and 
planned behavior (Madden et al., 1992; Notani, 1998), 
transaction cost theory (Geyskens et al., 2006), five-
factor model of personality (Judge et al., 2002), leader-
member exchange theory (Gerstener & Day, 1997), 
organizational citizenship behavior theory (LePine et 
al., 2002), expectancy theory (Van Eerde & Thierry, 
1996), transformational and transactional leadership 
theory (Judge & Piccolo, 2004), resource dependence 
theory (Drees & Heugens, 2013), organizational support 
theory (Kurtessis et al., 2017), technology-structure 
relationship theory (Miller et al., 1991), and challenge 
stressor-hindrance stressor framework (LePine et al., 
2005). These meta-analyses assess whether a theory is 
still valid and whether, after many years of research on 
a theory, its main tenets are still supported (Drees & 
Heugens, 2013; Van Eerde & Thierry, 1996; Petter & 
McLean, 2009), integrate one theory with other theories 
to develop a new theory (Colquitt, LePine, & Noe, 
2000), expand a theory by testing assumptions not 
assessed in past research (Drees & Heugens, 2013; Wu 
& Lederer, 2009), contrast different theories with each 
other (Judge & Piccolo, 2004), revise specific constructs 
in a theory by excluding constructs or distinguishing 
across types of constructs (Geyskens et al., 2006; LePine 
et al., 2002), and introduce new contingency variables 
to a theory (Miller et al., 1991). Against this backdrop, 
we use a meta-analysis to reexamine UTAUT and 
extend it in several ways as will be explained next.

3 Literature Review 
3.1 
Overview of UTAUT 
UTAUT was developed based on a comprehensive 
synthesis of previous technology acceptance and use 
studies (Venkatesh et al., 2003). The four constructs 
with main effects on intention in UTAUT, hereafter 
UTAUT predictors, that have been found to have an 
influence on the behavioral intention and use of 
technology are performance expectancy, effort 
expectancy, 
social 
influence, 
and 
facilitating 
conditions. Performance expectancy is the degree to 
which technology provides benefits to users when 
performing certain activities. Effort expectancy is the 
degree of ease associated with using a technology. 
Social influence is the degree to which a user perceives 
that important others believe the user should use the 
technology. Facilitating conditions are the degree to 
which a user believes there is an organizational and 
technical infrastructure that supports the use of the 
technology. According to UTAUT, behavioral 
intention to use technology is influenced by 
performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social 
influence, whereas technology use is influenced by 
behavioral intention and facilitating conditions. When 
extending the theory for consumer contexts, i.e., in 
UTAUT2, Venkatesh et al. (2012) also included 
hedonic motivation, habit, and price value as context-
dependent predictors. UTAUT further theorizes that 
age, gender, experience, and voluntariness moderate 
various relationships, whereas UTAUT2 drops 
voluntariness for consumer settings. 
Since its introduction, UTAUT has been applied in a 
wide range of contexts such as mobile banking (Zhou 
et al., 2010), e-government (Venkatesh et al., 2011), 
and electronic medical records (Hennington & Janz, 
2007). Whereas some researchers have applied this 
theory in different contexts without any modification, 
others integrated it with other theories, thus extending 
UTAUT/UTAUT2 (Venkatesh et al., 2016b). As 
Venkatesh et al. (2016b) note in their review of this 
theory, 
UTAUT 
still 
offers 
many 
promising 
opportunities for further theoretical development.  
First, Venkatesh et al. (2016b) emphasize that more 
research is needed with respect to new UTAUT 
predictors that can be added to the theory. Some 
studies tested potential predictors of behavioral 
intention (Appendix A). Most of these studies 
examined one or two potential additional variables, 
which raises a concern as it appears to be ad hoc and 
thus not systematic (see Venkatesh et al., 2016b). Also, 
most of these studies did not test the additional 
variables together with all UTAUT predictors. It is 
thus difficult to assess whether they perform better or 
worse than established UTAUT predictors. Also, many 
variables discussed in various other acceptance 
theories have not been considered as extensions. 
Generally, the findings for different extensions are 
mixed and based on single-context studies with small 
sample sizes. Further, it should be noted that most 
studies proposed new predictors for behavioral 
intention rather than use (Appendix B). So far, only six 
studies have suggested potential predictors of use. 
Thus, UTAUT would also benefit from a systematic 
assessment of potential predictors of use. Again, we 
found that many predictors of intention or use 
suggested by other theories have the potential to be 
added to UTAUT because strong effects were 
observed in some extension studies. For instance, 
Eckhardt et al. (2009) enriched the social influence 
construct with five dimensions based on the source of 
the influence (i.e., customers, suppliers).  
Despite the various studies that extend other variables, 
it remains unclear which of these predictors should be 
included to increase the amount of explained variance 
in technology use over and above the variance 
explained by current predictors. The choice of 
predictors becomes even more difficult because 
UTAUT studies frequently produce inconsistent 
results, with numerous studies reporting rather weak 
effects. For example, Teo et al. (2015) found that 
performance expectancy does not affect a user’s 
intention to accept mobile payments, whereas effort 
expectancy was found to play an important role. This 
contradicts findings from the original UTAUT that 
found performance expectancy rather than effort 
expectancy to be the most important predictor of 
behavioral intention. Some of these inconsistencies 
could be attributed to researchers not applying the full 
UTAUT or using sample sizes in their research that are 
too small (Teo et al., 2015). Nonetheless, it remains 
unclear how well the existing UTAUT predictors 
explain technology acceptance and which new 
constructs add value to the theory.  
Second, Venkatesh et al. (2016) encourage further 
research on the influence of contextual factors in 
UTAUT and they suggest shifting the focus from 
examining “UTAUT in context” to a focus on 
“UTAUT of context”. Extension studies examining 
contextual moderators are rather scarce (Appendix C). 
Existing studies often focus on only a few variables 
and moderators. These studies mainly examine lower-
level moderators related to the user rather than higher-
level moderators (see Venkatesh et al., 2016b), 
describing the study context. Hence, not many macro-
level moderators have been assessed in prior 
extensions studies. We observed that hardly any 
studies examined more than two countries representing 
different cultures or more than two technologies. The 
UTAUT literature is thus lacking in cross-technology 
and 
cross-cultural 
comparisons. 
Cross-context 
theorizing provides insights on the generalizability of 
a theory and the context dependence of its predictors.

These insights are needed because it is unclear whether 
the importance of UTAUT predictors differs, for instance, 
across technologies, organizations, or cultures. Although 
some studies have examined technology type (Wong et 
al., 2014) and location differences (Al-Gahtani et al., 
2007), the literature still lacks a comprehensive 
assessment of these factors using a large dataset, 
especially one spanning various values of these factors, 
which is often only available in meta-analyses. It 
therefore remains unclear which higher-level contextual 
factors exert moderating influences on UTAUT in 
addition to its individual-level moderators (e.g., age, 
gender). Venkatesh et al. (2016b) explain that cross-
context theorizing provides researchers insight into how 
to better interpret empirical findings and modify UTAUT 
to better suit different contexts. Kamakura et al. (2014, p. 
121) 
emphasize 
the 
importance 
of 
empirical 
generalization using meta-analysis by explaining that 
“grouping related studies (replications) can provide a 
more powerful test of specific theories than any single 
study as well as help identify boundary conditions for 
them.”  
Against this background, our meta-analysis examines two 
potential 
areas 
of 
extensions 
to 
UTAUT, 
as 
recommended by Venkatesh et al. (2016): (1) the addition 
of new endogenous mechanisms from different theories, 
and (2) the addition of new moderating mechanisms to 
examine the generalizability of UTAUT in different 
contexts. The next section provides an overview of these 
two types of extensions. 
3.2 
UTAUT Extensions/Predictors 
Based on a review of the articles included in our meta-
analysis, we found that researchers commonly use 
predictors from seven theories to extend UTAUT. 
Despite the fact that UTAUT was previously built on 
some of these theories (e.g., TAM), these studies have 
commonly used endogenous constructs from diffusion of 
innovation theory, theory of planned behavior, 
information systems success model, big-five personality, 
social-demographic predictors, and risk theory. Variables 
used to extend UTAUT are examined in Appendices A 
and B. As shown in these appendices, there is a wide 
range of variables that have been used to extend UTAUT. 
Many of these studies have found that other predictors 
(e.g., personal innovativeness) show an influence in the 
presence of existing UTAUT variables, suggesting that 
UTAUT may have potentially excluded some other 
important predictors. However, given that there are so 
many variables that have been proposed in these studies, 
it would not be practical to have a parsimonious model by 
integrating all these variables into one model and testing 
them in one large-scale data collection effort. Many of 
these studies also attributed these different results or 
predictors to different contextual factors such as location 
or the technology type studied. The next section further 
explains these moderators. 
3.3 
Moderators Influencing UTAUT 
Relationships 
3.3.1 
Moderators Proposed in UTAUT  
The original UTAUT states that the importance of 
different predictors depends on four moderators. These 
moderators are related to the user, namely the user’s 
gender, age, and experience, and to the use context, 
namely voluntariness of technology use (Venkatesh et 
al., 2003). For example, Venkatesh et al. (2003) found 
that the strength of the relationship between 
performance expectancy and intention varies by 
gender and age, with stronger relationships for men 
and younger users. They found the relationship 
between effort expectancy and intention relationship to 
be moderated by three user characteristics, with 
stronger effects for women, older users, and more 
experienced users. Different moderating effects were 
also observed for other UTAUT relationships.  
When developing UTAUT2, Venkatesh et al. (2012) 
reexamined the moderators in this theory. They 
dropped voluntariness, given that all consumer 
decisions are voluntary, but still included age, gender, 
and experience. They proposed that these user 
characteristics influence not only the effects of the four 
predictors proposed in the original UTAUT but also 
the new constructs included in UTAUT2 (hedonic 
motivation, price value, and habit). UTAUT2 thereby 
contributes to a better understanding of user 
differences in adopting new technologies that is 
essential to understand the boundary conditions of the 
theory. Interestingly, Venkatesh et al. (2012, 2016b) 
note that most studies that apply UTAUT in various 
technology contexts often include only the main 
effects and not the moderating variables. Thus, it is 
unclear to what extent the moderating effects proposed 
in UTAUT can be generalized to different settings. Our 
meta-analysis therefore reexamines these moderating 
effects using a comprehensive dataset covering 
numerous technologies and users. 
3.3.2 
Current State of Research on UTAUT 
Moderators  
In their review of UTAUT research, Venkatesh et al. 
(2016b) particularly stressed the need to study more 
contextual effects. They reviewed the various 
extensions of UTAUT proposed in the literature and 
noted that some studies suggest the inclusion of new 
moderating mechanisms. Most of these extensions still 
refer to user differences, such as the user’s technology 
readiness (Borrero et al., 2014), adopters versus 
nonadopters (Eckhardt et al., 2009), and ethnicity, 
religion, language, employment, income, education, 
and marital status (Liew et al., 2014). Few studies can 
be found that examine other moderators describing the 
broader contextual setting such as technology type and 
national culture setting. Regarding technology type,

some studies compared specific technologies with each 
other such as e-learning tools vs. online games (Oh & 
Yoon, 2014), different IT service types (Thong et al., 
2011), and type of recommender systems (Wang et al., 
2012). These technology types provide important 
insights into technology differences but they cannot be 
used to comprehensively classify various technologies 
examined in UTAUT studies. Similarly, few UTAUT 
studies consider country differences, and those few 
that do usually examine only two countries—for 
example, UTAUT differences in Saudi Arabia versus 
the USA (Alaiad et al., 2013), South Korea versus the 
USA (Im et al., 2011), and China versus the USA 
(Venkatesh & Zhang, 2010). Franke and Richey (2010, 
p. 1275) explain that “typically, two countries are 
selected judgmentally to represent different levels of 
one 
or 
more 
cultural 
factors.” 
Two-country 
comparisons have substantial limitations but are 
common because of practical constraints. Franke and 
Richey (2010) further explain that studies should avoid 
these types of comparisons because findings for a 
particular variable may be caused by factors other than 
the one(s) studied. They instead recommend including 
a larger number of countries, with each country having 
its own culture profile to ensure that the observed 
finding can be attributed to the country characteristic 
of interest. 
3.4 
User Characteristics as Moderators 
UTAUT proposes that several user characteristics, 
namely age, gender, and experience, exert moderating 
effects on various relationships (Venkatesh et al., 
2003). We exclude voluntariness of use because most 
studies do not report this information and there are thus 
challenges in accurately coding this moderator 
(Appendix D). Whereas age is proposed to interact 
with 
all 
UTAUT 
predictors, 
the 
remaining 
characteristics, such as gender and experience, only 
interact with selected UTAUT predictors—e.g., 
performance expectancy and effort expectancy. 
Despite user characteristics being a key element of 
UTAUT, subsequent researchers who have used this 
theory have often ignored these moderating effects 
(Venkatesh et al., 2016b). It remains largely unknown 
whether the moderating effects of user characteristics 
also matter in different contextual settings. It may be 
that many of the existing UTAUT studies do not report 
such moderating effects because they may have shown 
nonsignificant effects in their specific study context. 
Thus, it remains unclear whether the proposed 
interactions are generalizable across contexts. Similar 
to UTAUT2, we propose that age and gender exert 
moderating effects on some relationships in the theory. 
Information about the average user age and gender is 
reported by most UTAUT studies, and a large number 
of studies can be compared. We do not derive specific 
new hypotheses for age and gender, as we expect the 
same moderating effects as in the original UTAUT, 
e.g., performance expectancy is most important for 
men and younger users. Instead, we focus on the 
potential differences between employees versus 
consumers because differences across these user 
groups have not been formally tested. 
In examining studies that apply UTAUT in the 
contexts of employees and consumers, we found that 
the constructs that predict behavioral intention and use 
vary across these categories. In the context of 
consumers, the UTAUT predictors typically show 
strong effects (Tan, 2013; Thong et al., 2011; Powell 
et al., 2012). When studying employees, however, 
some studies have found that not all of the constructs 
are important. Several studies have, for example, found 
that effort expectancy does not affect employees’ 
behavioral 
intentions 
toward 
using 
various 
technologies (e.g., Lin et al., 2013; Decman, 2015; 
Šumak & Šorgo, 2016). This is in line with our 
reasoning because, in organizational settings, the use 
of technology or systems is often mandated by the 
organization regardless of how the employees perceive 
the effort required to use it. For similar reasons, it can 
be expected that other UTAUT predictors, including 
performance expectancy (Chen & Chen, 2015) and 
social influence (Lin et al., 2013), would show weaker 
effects in studies examining employees’ behaviors. 
Venkatesh et al. (2012) revised UTAUT for consumer 
contexts, arguing that the motivations to use 
technology differ according to employee contexts. 
Venkatesh et al. (2012) introduced hedonic motivation, 
price value, and habit, and we expect that these 
predictors will show stronger effects for consumer 
contexts. Thus, we hypothesize: 
H1: The effects of (a) performance expectancy, (b) 
effort expectancy, (c) social influence, (d) 
hedonic motivation, (e) price value, and (f) habit 
on behavioral intention and use will be weaker in 
employee contexts compared to consumer 
contexts. 
3.5 
National Culture as Moderator 
When discussing future research or study limitations, 
many UTAUT studies regularly suggest conducting 
large-scale cross-country comparisons (Teo et al., 
2015). We therefore consider national culture as a 
moderator. Culture is defined as “the collective 
programming of the mind which distinguishes the 
members of one human group from another” 
(Hofstede, 1991, p. 5). Culture can influence 
individuals’ social behaviors (Dinev et al., 2009). Past 
studies have used different approaches when 
examining the role of culture in understanding 
acceptance and use. We use Hofstede’s (2001) culture 
model to assess the moderating effects of four culture 
dimensions because this concept is widely used and 
has been shown to explain technology use across 
cultures (Srite & Karahanna, 2006). Existing UTAUT

19 
studies examine some of Hofstede’s four original 
culture dimensions or refer to this concept when 
comparing two countries (Appendix C). Straub et al. 
(2002) explained that social identity theory is an 
important theoretical approach to study culture. 
According to this theory, individuals are likely to 
identify themselves as part of a culture, and this has an 
impact on their use of technologies (Im et al., 2011). 
Given the importance of culture for an individual’s 
technology adoption decisions, and in response to the 
call of Venkatesh et al. (2016b) for further research on 
the role of environmental factors on UTAUT, we 
differentiate across four culture dimensions: (1) power 
distance, 
(2) 
individualism-collectivism, 
(3) 
uncertainty avoidance, and (4) masculinity-femininity. 
We tested the effects of these four original culture 
moderators but not long-term orientation (Appendix D 
discusses our rationale for its exclusion). 
Power distance refers to the extent to which consumers 
in a culture expect and accept inequality in a system 
(Hofstede, 2001). There is an expectation in high 
power distance cultures that powerful members of 
society should take care of the less powerful. We 
therefore assume that users in high power distance 
cultures expect the firm to take care of the users’ 
technology problems and provide support (Hofstede, 
2001). In relation to UTAUT, it is reasonable to expect 
some differences between the findings of UTAUT, 
especially regarding social influence, across cultures 
with different levels of power distance. In high power 
distance cultures, individuals would be expected to 
submit to the influence of those they consider to be in 
a higher social position than themselves. In such 
cultures, when people in high power positions adopt a 
technology or have positive feelings toward it, their 
subordinates and those in lower positions would be less 
willing to disturb the social norm and disagree with or 
deviate from their wishes. Thus, the effect of social 
influence would be expected to be stronger in such 
cultures, in comparison to cultures with low power 
distance where individuals are more independent. This 
observation is in agreement with the analysis of Sun 
and Zhang’s (2006) analysis of the situational 
limitations of technology acceptance studies and the 
findings of Al-Gahtani et al. (2007), who compared 
users’ behavioral intentions in Saudi Arabia and in the 
USA, and found social influence to have a stronger 
effect on behavioral intentions in Saudi Arabia than in 
the USA. One reason they gave for this effect was the 
difference in power distance in the two countries.  
Similarly, in high power distance cultures, when users 
with a low standing in the society consider using a 
technology, 
they 
expect 
firms 
to 
provide 
organizational and technical infrastructure to support 
the use of the system. Hofstede (2001) explained that 
in high power distance cultures, individuals expect 
more powerful members of society, including public 
and private institutions such as firms and technology 
service providers, to provide support and structure. 
Therefore, we also anticipate that facilitating 
conditions will show stronger effects in high power 
distance cultures. Hofstede et al. (2010) provide a 
further argument about why facilitating conditions 
have greater importance in high power distance 
cultures. They explain that individuals in high power 
distance cultures appreciate social status and 
preferential treatment more than individuals in low 
power distance cultures (Hofstede et al., 2010). 
Providing 
support 
implies 
that 
users 
receive 
preferential treatment from firms that enhances their 
reputation (i.e., status). In high power distance 
cultures, users are therefore more likely to use a 
technology when facilitating conditions exist that 
support the use of the technology. We found these 
patterns to be borne out in studies carried out in both 
high power distance cultures (e.g., Ali et al., 2016; 
Khorasanizadeh et al., 2016) and low power distance 
cultures (e.g., Järvinen et al., 2016). Thus, we 
hypothesize: 
H2: The effects of (a) social influence and (b) 
facilitating conditions on behavioral intention 
and use will be stronger in high power distance 
cultures. 
Individualism-collectivism refers to the extent to which 
people prefer to act as individuals, rather than as 
members of a group, and whether they prioritize their 
own needs compared to group needs (Hofstede, 2001). 
As Steenkamp and Geyskens (2006, p. 139) explained, 
users in “individualistic societies place their personal 
goals, motivations, and desires ahead of those of 
others, whereas collectivistic cultures are conformity 
oriented and show a higher degree of group behavior 
and concern to promote their continued existence.” As 
a result, some UTAUT predictors are expected to show 
stronger effects in individualistic cultures than in  
collectivistic cultures. The UTAUT predictors that are 
likely to display stronger effects in individualistic 
cultures are related to the individual’s personal goals, 
motivations, and desires such as performance 
expectancy 
and 
hedonic 
motivation. 
While 
performance expectancy relates to the benefits the 
individual receives when using a technology, hedonic 
motivation relates to the fun and pleasure the 
individual derives when using the technology 
(Venkatesh et al., 2012). However, factors related to 
group needs and group behavior are more important in 
collectivistic cultures. Thus, the effect of social 
influence will be stronger in collectivistic cultures 
because this predictor relates to the degree to which 
users perceive that important others believe they 
should use the technology (Venkatesh et al., 2003). 
Some evidence of this is found in the existing 
literature. In comparative studies between cultures 
characterized by individualism versus collectivism,

Meta-Analysis of UTAUT 
 
20 
performance expectancy was shown to have greater 
importance in individualistic cultures, whereas social 
influence had greater importance in collectivistic 
cultures (Im et al., 2011; Udo et al., 2016; Venkatesh 
& Zhang, 2010). Furthermore, hedonic motivation is 
consistently important in studies carried out in 
individualistic cultures (Gao et al., 2015; Morosan & 
DeFranco, 2016; Ozturk et al., 2016).  
The cross-cultural literature stresses that users in 
individualistic cultures show greater achievement 
orientation than users in collectivistic cultures (Nelson 
& Shavitt, 2002). This literature refers to the theory of 
achievement motivation, which argues that personal 
success is related to reaching individual goals, which 
is more motivating to users in individualistic cultures 
(McClelland, 1961). In collectivistic cultures, users are 
more likely to be motivated by socially oriented goals. 
Among all individualistic cultures, the USA is the 
prototypical example of a culture where individuals are 
achievement oriented (Nelson & Shavitt, 2002). It is 
important in individualistic cultures to display 
“personal success through demonstrating competence 
according to social standards” (Schwartz, 1992, p. 8). 
Accordingly, users in individualistic cultures will try 
harder to learn to use a new technology, independent 
of the required effort. Consequently, effort expectancy 
will be less important as a predictor in individualistic 
versus collectivistic cultures. Thus, we hypothesize: 
H3: The effects of (a) performance expectancy and (b) 
hedonic motivation on behavioral intention and use 
will be stronger in individualistic cultures, whereas 
the effects of (c) social influence and (d) effort 
expectancy will be stronger in collectivistic 
cultures. 
Masculinity-femininity addresses whether a culture 
embraces values that are typically associated with 
masculinity 
or 
femininity 
(Hofstede, 
2001). 
“Masculine” 
cultures 
value 
advancement, 
competitiveness, 
and 
performance, 
whereas 
“feminine” cultures value cooperation, modesty, 
consensus, and quality of life (Hofstede, 2001). Srite 
and Karahanna (2006) explained that in this context, 
the process of gender-role identification is related to an 
individual’s espoused masculinity/femininity values. 
According to this line of inquiry, individuals learn 
society’s gender role standards and expectations and 
acquire attitudes, behaviors, and values that are viewed 
as gender-acceptable and appropriate (Srite & 
Karahanna, 2006). Because users in masculine cultures 
are performance oriented and more competitive, they 
tend to emphasize the performance expectancy of 
technology and focus less on effort expectancy and 
facilitating conditions. Further, in organizational 
environments that are typically goal orientated, people 
in masculine cultures will likely be more eager to adopt 
a technology in order to facilitate better work 
performance (Srite & Karahanna, 2006). Venkatesh 
and Morris (2000) also suggest that users in masculine 
cultures will be more concerned with whether the 
technology will be able to carry out the tasks intended. 
Taylor and Hall (1982) also propose that masculine 
cultures more easily connect with instrumental actions 
such as the achievement of work goals and 
performance improvements. In feminine cultures, 
users tend to be more concerned with effort expectancy 
and social influence because they are less concerned 
with instrumental goals and more interested in 
improving their quality of life and developing 
relationships with others (Srite & Karahanna, 2006). 
People in masculine cultures can be characterized as 
risk takers, optimists, and function oriented. People in 
feminine cultures tend to value sharing, focus on 
avoiding losses, and are generally more experientially 
oriented (He et al., 2008). In comparisons between 
masculine and feminine cultures, some studies have 
found that masculine cultures favor performance 
expectancy, whereas effort expectancy, facilitating 
conditions, and social influence are more important in 
feminine cultures (e.g., Im et al., 2011; Jung & Lee 
2015; Pramatari & Theotokis, 2009; Yuen et al., 2010). 
Moreover, Venkatesh and Morris (2000) suggest that 
the need to stand out and be unique in social circles in 
feminine cultures heightens the importance of 
facilitating conditions for such individuals. They argue 
that the prominence of social/affiliation needs for 
individuals who espouse feminine values increases the 
importance placed on the availability of technology 
support staff for such individuals. Thus, we 
hypothesize: 
H4: The effect of (a) performance expectancy on 
behavioral intention and use will be stronger in 
masculine cultures, whereas the effects of (b) 
effort expectancy, (c) social influence, and (d) 
facilitating conditions will be stronger in 
feminine cultures. 
Uncertainty avoidance refers to “the extent to which 
the members of a culture feel threatened by uncertain 
or unknown situations” (Hofstede, 1991, p. 113). 
Uncertainty avoidance is the degree to which a person 
prefers 
structured 
over 
unstructured 
situations 
(Hofstede, 1980). Individuals in high uncertainty 
avoidance 
cultures 
display 
a 
preference 
for 
predictability 
over 
ambiguity. 
Users 
in 
high 
uncertainty avoidance cultures are more likely to 
experience high levels of anxiety when confronted 
with problems or challenges. Therefore, users in 
cultures displaying high uncertainty avoidance may 
show resistance toward efforts promoting technologies 
that are new or that contain an element of risk (e.g., 
mobile banking). Such users would be more inclined 
toward traditional services with richer interaction, such 
as face-to-face communication, versus technologies 
where use has high levels of ambiguity (Straub et al., 
1997). Technology users in high uncertainty avoidance

21 
cultures cope with uncertainties by relying more 
strongly on facilitating conditions. In cultures with low 
uncertainty avoidance, people are more relaxed, are 
more willing to take risks or try something new, and 
tend to be more comfortable in uncertain situations. 
With regard to persuasion and processing information, 
uncertainty-oriented persons are better able to process 
arguments and require less heuristic assistance 
(Chaiken, 1980), whereas certainty-oriented persons 
typically require more heuristic assistance (e.g., 
facilitating conditions and social influence) and are 
less willing to engage in the systematic processing of 
information (e.g., personal assessment of new 
technologies) (Sorrentino et al., 1988). One would 
expect that higher levels of facilitating conditions 
would need to be present for users to be able to 
overcome the uncertainty involved in accepting new 
technologies in high uncertainty avoidance cultures 
(Thatcher et al., 2007). Similarly, regarding the 
acceptance of technologies, individuals in such 
cultures are likely to conform with the social influence 
they perceive from the people in their surroundings. 
Relying on social influence can provide users in high 
uncertainty avoidance cultures with reassurance about 
technology use. Jung and Lee (2015) found that 
facilitating conditions are important in determining 
students’ behavioral intentions in high uncertainty 
avoidance cultures, whereas for students in low 
uncertainty avoidance cultures, they were found to be 
unimportant. Jung and Lee (2015) also found that 
social influence had a greater effect on students from 
high uncertainty avoidance cultures. In contrast, in 
other studies conducted on users from high uncertainty 
avoidance cultures, social influence has consistently 
been determined to have weaker effects (Martins et al., 
2014; Oliveira et al., 2016). Our meta-analysis can 
unearth the cumulative effect. We argue that it is more 
important to users in high uncertainty avoidance 
cultures that technology is easy to use because it helps 
them to better understand the technology. Users who 
do not fully understand technology may feel 
uncomfortable with the uncertainty in the situation. 
Thus, we hypothesize: 
H5: The effects of (a) facilitating conditions, (b) social 
influence, and (c) effort expectancy on behavioral 
intention and use will be stronger in high 
uncertainty avoidance cultures. 
3.6 
Technology Characteristics as 
Moderators 
Despite the maturity of technology acceptance 
research, many studies have not considered the effects 
of technology types (Im et al., 2008). As proposed by 
 
2 Blut, Wang, and Schoefer’s (2016) meta-analysis examined 
96 studies testing various factors influencing the acceptance 
of self-service technology. They found differences 
Venkatesh et al. (2016b), technology type is a 
dimension of context that can be applied to UTAUT 
research. UTAUT was developed during a time when 
the internet was still growing and not as widely used as 
it is today. Thus, the literature lacks a comparison of 
the usefulness of UTAUT for internet versus non-
internet technologies. Meuter et al. (2000) developed a 
technology classification based on a comprehensive 
literature review. They classify different technologies 
depending on their main purpose (transaction versus 
non-transaction technologies) and the interface (online 
versus offline technologies). Meuter et al. (2000) use 
this classification to explore the expectations of 
technology users. We adapt this classification in this 
meta-analysis and extend it using a third criterion. 
Balasubramanian et al. (2002) argue that mobile 
technologies differ from non-mobile technologies 
because of their flexibility in receiving services 
independent of time and space. Thus, users may also 
have different expectations about mobile versus non-
mobile, technologies. Using these three criteria allows 
us to classify most technologies examined in prior 
UTAUT research and test the generalizability of this 
theory across these broad technology categories. 2  
Thus, we consider three main types of technology in 
our meta-analysis: (1) transaction-based vs. non-
transaction-based technologies, (2) internet-based vs. 
non-internet-based technologies, and (3) mobile-based 
vs. non-mobile-based technologies. It should be noted 
that one specific technology studied may belong to 
more than one of the mentioned categories. For 
example, mobile banking services used for transferring 
money are classified as a transaction, internet-based, 
mobile technology.  
For transaction versus non-transaction technologies, 
we examine whether technologies used to conduct 
financial transactions differ from technologies not 
supporting such transactions (Escobar-Rodríguez & 
Carvajal-Trujillo, 2014). Users may have different 
expectations depending on this technology moderator 
(Meuter et al., 2000). For example, transaction 
technologies are related to potential financial losses 
that make the performance expectancy of the 
technology have greater importance (Blut et al., 2016). 
In addition to the potential negative consequences of 
use, technologies differ regarding their extent of 
process standardization, with transaction technologies 
being more standardized (Goodhue, 1995; Meuter et 
al., 2000). Thus, we assume facilitating conditions to 
have weaker effects for transaction technologies since 
they are more standardized. Because of the 
uncertainties of use, users frequently use technology 
with which they are familiar, which in turn leads to the 
development of habits. Users also satisfy their hedonic 
depending on the purpose of technology (i.e., transaction 
technology) and interface (i.e., Internet technology). They 
did not consider mobile technologies.

22 
consumption needs with transaction technologies—for 
example, shopping online allows users to buy products 
that address their hedonic needs, and the process of 
shopping online may also be a form of hedonic 
consumption. Thus, hedonic motivation has greater 
importance. For non-transaction-based technologies, 
facilitating conditions may be more important because 
the technologies are less standardized and serve 
various purposes (Chiu & Wang, 2008). In the context 
of transaction-based technologies, Baptista and 
Oliveira (2015) found habit and performance 
expectancy to be the strongest predictors of intention 
and habit to be the strongest predictor of use. 
AbuShanab et al. (2010) similarly found performance 
expectancy to be the strongest predictor of intention 
regarding 
transaction 
technologies. 
Thus, 
we 
hypothesize: 
H6: The effect of (a) performance expectancy, (b) 
hedonic motivations, and (c) habits on behavioral 
intention and use will be stronger for transaction 
technologies, whereas (d) facilitating conditions 
will be stronger for non-transaction technologies. 
Regarding internet versus non-internet technologies, 
we propose user expectations to differ according to this 
technology moderator (Meuter et al., 2000). We 
propose that social norms gain importance for internet 
technologies. A number of these technologies have 
been integrated into social networking sites and apps 
that help to connect people and social groups (Blut et 
al., 2016). Thus, the social norms of the user’s social 
groups are more likely to influence the use of internet-
based technologies. Further, internet technologies are 
less tangible than non-internet technologies because 
there is hardly any physical aspect of the technology 
for the user to evaluate (Koernig, 2003). As such, users 
have more difficulty comprehending how to use the 
technology and require more support from the firm, 
thus endowing the user’s effort expectancy and 
facilitation conditions with greater importance for 
decision-making. Some studies suggest similar effects. 
For example, in studies related to e-government 
service, effort expectancy was the strongest predictor 
of intention (Lian, 2015) and social influence was also 
found to be an important predictor of intention 
(Krishnaraju et al., 2016). Thus, we hypothesize: 
H7: The effects of (a) effort expectancy, (b) facilitating 
conditions, and (c) social influence on behavioral 
intention and use will be stronger for internet than 
non-internet technologies. 
We also propose differences for mobile versus non-
mobile technologies because user expectations may 
differ for this moderator (Balasubramanian et al., 
2002). Mobile technologies have changed how users 
interact with and accept new technology. Although 
mobile technologies allow more flexibility and 
independence in the use of a technology in terms of 
space and time (Balasubramanian et al., 2002), users 
are more dependent on this technology because they 
have fewer alternative technologies they can use when 
mobile. When mobile, users cannot easily switch to 
alternative technologies when the focal technology is 
not working or when they struggle to use the 
technology. They may have other, alternative 
technologies available at home or at work but they are 
heavily reliant on mobile technology when away from 
home or work. Thus, the performance of mobile 
technology, as well as effort expectancy and 
facilitating conditions, is important. At home or work, 
users may be able to switch to alternative technologies, 
but when mobile, the technology must perform reliably 
and be easy to use, and support will be beneficial for 
the user. In studies on mobile learning, Milošević et al. 
(2015) found performance expectancy to be the 
strongest predictor of intention. Wang et al. (2009) also 
reported the same, with effort expectancy being the 
second strongest predictor (second to performance 
expectancy). Facilitating conditions were also found to 
affect the intention to adopt mobile apps (Hew et al., 
2015). Thus, we hypothesize:  
H8: The effects of (a) performance expectancy, (b) 
effort expectancy, and (c) facilitating conditions 
on behavioral intention and use will be stronger 
for mobile than for non-mobile, technologies. 
4 Method 
4.1 
Data Collection and Coding 
We followed Hunter and Schmidt’s (2004) and Gerow 
et al.’s (2014) approach by initially conducting our 
literature search using keywords in various electronic 
databases (e.g., ABI/INFORM, JSTOR, Proquest, 
Academic Search, Scopus, Web of Science, ACM 
Digital Library, Science Direct, and EBSCO/Business 
Source 
Premier). 
Conference 
proceedings, 
dissertations, and theses were all included in the search 
in order to avoid bias toward larger effect sizes (Gerow 
et al., 2014). Therefore, we included the AIS 
Electronic Library (to collect AIS conference 
proceedings), IEEE Xplore, and the ProQuest 
Dissertations & Theses and WorldCat Dissertations 
and Theses databases in our search. In addition, we 
examined the initial articles on UTAUT (Venkatesh et 
al., 2003; Venkatesh et al., 2012) and examined the 
studies 
that 
cited 
these 
initial 
articles. 
We 
complemented this search with further web searches to 
compile a comprehensive list of empirical studies on 
UTAUT. To ensure that we captured all relevant 
articles, we also conducted a manual search of leading 
IS journals (e.g., AIS Basket of Eight journals) and 
business journals that have served as outlets for 
UTAUT research. We used Google Scholar to identify 
articles that referenced papers we had already 
identified, and we emailed 1,258 authors in our list of 


---
## Page 12

Journal of the Association for Information Systems 
 
23 
papers to see if they had additional correlation tables 
that had not been published.  
We used three criteria to determine the suitability of 
the collected studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. 
First, the studies must be empirical (e.g., survey, 
experiment, or both) at the user/employee unit of 
analysis. Second, correlation coefficients or other 
statistical information that could be used to calculate 
correlations must be reported. Third, the study had to 
report on an independent dataset to ensure that we did 
not include studies relying on the same dataset twice in 
our meta-analysis. Appendix D provides more details 
about this screening process. In total, we gathered 
1,451 usable articles. These articles included 1,149 
studies published in journals, 268 studies from 
conference proceedings, 17 dissertations, and 17 
unpublished studies. The study characteristics (e.g., 
effect sizes, sample sizes, type of technology) were 
extracted by two independent coders, with an interrater 
agreement of 98%. In those few cases where coding of 
effect sizes was unclear, the coding was discussed 
among the authors and resolved. When classifying 
effect sizes, the coders were given the construct 
definitions and aliases presented in Appendix E. They 
received definitions for moderators that they used to 
classify study contexts and, once again, there was high 
interrater agreement (Appendix D). 
4.2 
Integration of Effect Sizes 
The meta-analysis uses correlation coefficients as 
effect sizes because they are scale independent and 
they are reported in most of the collected studies. In 
those cases when correlations were not reported in the 
paper, we transformed regression coefficients to 
correlations when possible (Peterson & Brown, 2005). 
Some samples reported more than one correlation of 
the same association between two constructs usually 
because of multiple measurements of the same 
constructs. In these cases, we calculated composite 
scores and reported them as a single study, as 
suggested by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). We also 
adjusted the respective reliability coefficients using 
Mosier’s (1943) formula. In total, we gathered 25,619 
effect sizes reported in 1,935 independent samples in 
1,451 articles. The cumulative size across collected 
samples was 737,112 users covering 77 countries 
worldwide. When empirical studies are characterized 
by 
methodological 
imperfections, 
such 
as 
measurement error (imperfect reliability), Borenstein 
et al. (2009) recommend conducting a psychometric 
meta-analysis that corrects estimates for these flaws by 
following the approach proposed by Hunter and 
Schmidt 
(2004). 
We 
therefore 
followed 
the 
suggestions by Hunter and Schmidt (2004). We first 
used reliability coefficients to correct for measurement 
errors in the dependent and the independent variables. 
Hunter and Schmidt (2004) suggest dividing each 
correlation by the square root of the product of the 
respective reliabilities of the two constructs of interest. 
Then, we weighted the reliability-adjusted correlations 
by sample size to address the sampling error. We 
calculated standard errors and 95% confidence 
intervals for each sample size weighted and reliability-
adjusted correlation.  
To assess the need for moderator analysis, we assessed 
the homogeneity of the effect size distribution using 
the Q-test that is a χ2 test of homogeneity (Hunter & 
Schmidt, 2004). A significant Q-test indicates the need 
for moderator analysis. We also calculated credibility 
intervals that show the distribution of effect sizes 
(Hunter & Schmidt, 2004). Wide credibility intervals 
also suggest variation in effect sizes and the need for 
moderator analysis to account for unexplained 
variance (Whitener, 1990). Finally, we calculated the 
percent of variance in observed correlations (PVA) 
that is attributable to sampling error and other artifacts. 
Hunter and Schmidt (2004) suggest moderator tests for 
PVAs lower than 75%.  
The robustness of our results and the possibility of 
publication bias was assessed using Rosenthal’s (1979) 
fail safe N (FSN). The FSN refers to the number of 
studies averaging null results necessary to lower a 
significant relationship to a barely significant level (p 
= 0.05). When developing this criterion, Rosenthal 
proposed tolerance levels and suggested that FSNs 
should be greater than 5 x k + 10 with k = number of 
correlations. High FSNs provide some evidence 
regarding the robustness of the results and highlight 
that the results are less likely to be influenced by 
publication bias. In addition to these statistics, we 
calculated the power of the employed statistical tests 
(Muncer et al., 2003). 
4.3 
Calculation of the Structural 
Equation Model (SEM) 
We tested UTAUT and the different extensions using 
SEM because this testing approach considers the 
interrelationships among all constructs at the same 
time. We used the coded effect sizes to compile a 
correlation 
matrix 
among 
all 
variables. 
This 
correlation matrix was used as input to LISREL 9.2 to 
test the different extensions of UTAUT. SEM uses the 
harmonic mean of all sample sizes as the sample size 
for the calculations (N=1,665). Viswesvaran and Ones 
(1995) suggest using the harmonic mean because it 
leads to more conservative SEM results than the 
arithmetic mean of sample sizes. The constructs in the 
SEM are measured with single indicators. Because 
measurement errors have already been corrected when 
integrating effect sizes, the error variances of 
constructs are set to zero. These analyses are 
frequently conducted in various meta-analyses (e.g., 
Palmatier et al., 2006).

Meta-Analysis of UTAUT

4.4 
Moderator Analysis 
We used a subgroup analysis to assess the effects of 
moderators. Specifically, Hunter and Schmidt (2004) 
discuss two types of subgroup analyses depending on the 
type of moderator variable. For dichotomous moderator 
variables, they suggest splitting the data set by the 
moderator variable and conducting a separate meta-
analysis within each subset of studies. For continuous 
moderators, Hunter and Schmidt (2004) suggest 
correlating the potential moderators with the coded effect 
sizes. They explain that “when moderators are continuous, 
the subgrouping method has the disadvantage of requiring 
dichotomization of the continuous variables to produce the 
subgroups, thus losing information. When there is only 
one operator to be examined and it is continuous, simple 
correlation can be used” (p. 390). Thus, we correlated each 
continuous moderator with the effect sizes.  
We coded the data for moderators. The dichotomous 
moderators were coded as dummy variables, including the 
user type (1 = consumer, 0 = employee), mobile technology 
(1 = mobile, 0 = non-mobile), online technology (1 = 
online, 0 = offline), and transaction technology (1 = 
transaction, 0 = non-transaction). We also coded the data 
for continuous moderators. We extracted the average user 
age for each sample (M = 34.83 years) and the percentage 
of women (M = 48.78%). The studies had data from 77 
different countries in our meta-analysis and for 58 of those 
countries, we could match the country with Hofstede’s 
(2001) culture dimensions. Similar to other meta-
analyses, we used the country information reported in 
each publication to match the coded correlations with 
scores for each of Hofstede’s culture dimensions from a 
secondary data source. Specifically, we matched the four 
dominant culture values reported by Hofstede et al. 
(2010) with the coded correlations similar to Samaha et 
al. (2014). The values of the culture dimensions in our 
meta-analysis range from 11 to 100 for power distance, 
from 14 to 91 for individualism/collectivism, from 5 to 96 
for masculinity/femininity, and from 8 to 100 for 
uncertainty avoidance. In cases where we could not match 
the country scores with our data, we used the mean 
country scores for each culture dimension.  
 In addition to these substantive moderators, we coded 
method moderators including the study year and the 
sampling approach as a dummy variable (1 = student 
sample; 0 = non-student). The year when the study was 
published is included as a moderator because the 
literature indicates that some factors may lose relevance 
over time (Venkatesh & Bala, 2008). Similarly, we 
assume that factors not related to a specific technology 
(i.e., personal innovativeness, education) show weaker 
effects over time, as users have dealt with a large number 
of different technologies, whereas factors specific to a 
technology 
gain 
importance 
(i.e., 
performance 
expectancy, 
effort 
expectancy, 
social 
influence, 
facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, price 
value, and costs). We also consider potential differences 
between student and non-student samples. Student 
samples tend to be more homogeneous than non-student 
samples (Pan & Zinkhan, 2006). Due to this 
homogeneity, the error variance of the constructs 
measured in student samples is lower compared to non-
student samples that in turn lead to stronger effect sizes 
(Peterson, 2001). More information about the data 
coding, effect size integration, SEM, and moderator 
analysis is reported in Appendix D. 
5 Results 
5.1 
Results of Univariate Analyses 
The final results of effect size integration are shown in 
Table 1.3 This table shows the results for the final model 
including the UTAUT predictors and the four suggested 
extension variables. We found all relationships between 
the predictor variables shown in Table 1 to be related to 
behavioral intention and use. We have excluded effect 
size outliers when integrating effect sizes because they 
have the potential to impact the findings. 
5.1.1 
Original UTAUT 
The results in Table 1 suggest that among the original 
UTAUT relationships, most studies examined the 
effects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, 
social influence, facilitating conditions, and hedonic 
motivation on intention. The strongest effects on 
intention can be observed for habit (sample-sized 
weighted-reliability adjusted correlation (rc = 0.66), 
performance expectancy (rc = 0.64), and hedonic 
motivation (rc = 0.53). Fewer studies have examined 
the effects of these predictors on use. In addition to 
behavioral intention (rc = 0.50), we found strong 
effects for habit (rc = 0.56) and performance 
expectancy (rc = 0.46) on use. The FSNs exceed the 
tolerance criterion suggested by Rosenthal (1979), thus 
suggesting the results were robust and less likely to be 
influenced by publication bias. The tests also show 
sufficient power. Also, the Q-test of homogeneity 
suggests substantial variance in effect sizes, giving an 
indication of contextual differences and the need for 
moderator analysis. Also, the credibility intervals were 
rather wide, suggesting the need for moderator 
analysis. Finally, the PVAs were lower than 75%, 
suggesting that a relatively small percentage of 
variance in effect sizes was attributable to sampling 
and measurement errors. Taken together, this pattern 
of results suggests the need for moderator analysis.

variables are reported in Appendix F.

5.1.2 
UTAUT Extensions  
Regarding the four extensions variables, we found that 
more 
studies 
examined 
relationships 
predicting 
intention rather than predicting use. The strongest 
relationships with intention can be observed for 
compatibility (rc = 0.66), personal innovativeness (rc = 
0.35), and education (rc = 0.18). Particularly, 
compatibility of technology (rc = 0.44) and personal 
innovativeness of the user (rc = 0.36) also showed strong 
effects on use. Costs of technology showed smaller 
effect sizes in the univariate analyses. Three of the costs 
and education credibility intervals included zero, 
suggesting that the true costs values could be negative 
or positive in some cases. The moderator analysis 
provides insights when the positive and negative effects 
are more likely. 4  For all relationships, the FSNs 
 
4 The moderator results in Table 4 suggest that the credibility 
interval for education-use relationship did not include zero for 
employees (0.00; 0.12) and transaction technologies (0.13; 
0.13). Also, the intervals of education- intention relationship did 
not include zero for employees (0.08; 0.28), non-Internet 
exceeded the tolerance criterion, suggesting that the 
results are robust. The power of tests was sufficient. 
Again, all conducted tests of homogeneity (i.e., Q-test 
of homogeneity, credibility intervals, PVAs) suggest the 
need to examine moderators. 
As suggested by Grewal et al. (2018), we also reported 
the results of the full data set with effect size outliers 
(Appendix G). The findings were largely similar. The 
effects of most extensions were slightly stronger after 
removing outliers. Further, we assessed whether the 
results differ across different measurements of UTAUT 
and extension constructs. For example, we compared 
effect sizes using narrow UTAUT definitions (e.g., 
performance expectancy) with effect sizes using aliases 
(e.g., usefulness) and did not observe any significant 
differences (Appendix H).
technologies (0.13; 0.13), mobile technologies (0.03; 0.15), and 
student samples (0.15; 0.78). Finally, the CR interval of the 
costs-behavioral intention relationship did not include zero for 
transaction technologies (-0.83; -0.10).

5.2 
Results of Structural Equation 
Modeling 
We used SEM to test whether inclusion of the four 
predictors 
improves 
UTAUT 
(i.e., 
technology 
compatibility, user education, personal innovativeness, 
and costs of technology). We tested further extensions 
discussed in the UTAUT literature (Appendix I-K). We 
considered 72 constructs in the full descriptive analyses 
and 32 constructs as potential extensions using SEM. The 
final model only considers the four extensions that 
explain the most variance in the dependent variables. We 
used the correlation matrix, shown in Table 2, as input in 
LISREL to calculate several models (Models 1-8, Table 
3). Table 3 shows the results of these tests. 5  The 
calculated models were assessed in terms of explained 
variance and model fit. As shown in Model 1, we first 
replicated UTAUT2, as proposed by Venkatesh et al. 
(2012). Then, we tested four models, each by adding one 
of the four extension variables (Models 2-5). Finally, we 
combined all four extensions to assess their joint 
influence together with UTAUT constructs (Models 6-8). 
As can be seen, the model fit of all calculated models was 
good. Model 8 explained the most variance in behavioral 
intention (74.1%) and use (47.2%). 
5.2.1 
Replication of UTAUT 
As shown in Model 1 in Table 3, the replication of 
UTAUT2 showed that our estimates using all available 
empirical studies led to results largely similar to what was 
found in the original study developing UTAUT2 
(Venkatesh et al., 2012). The estimated model explained 
63.2% of variance in intention (original study: 44%) and 
36.2% (original study: 35%) of use. Similar to Venkatesh 
et al. (2012), we found strong effects of the same 
predictors 
on 
intention, 
including 
performance 
expectancy (0.31 vs 0.21 in original study), effort 
expectancy (0.10 vs 0.16), hedonic motivation (0.08 vs 
 
5 We also calculated the models using the data set with effect size 
outliers (Appendix L); results are comparable. 
0.23), price value (0.21 vs 0.14), and habit (0.40 vs 0.32). 
Some relationships were slightly weaker in our meta-
analysis, presumably due to the large number of different 
technologies being examined. For example, we found 
weaker effects for social influence (-0.05 vs 0.14) and 
facilitating conditions (-0.04 vs 0.16) in our meta-analysis 
than in the original UTAUT2 study. Similar to Venkatesh 
et al. (2012), we found strong effects for habit (0.40) and 
performance expectancy (0.31). In predicting use, the 
results of our meta-analysis were also comparable to the 
original UTAUT2 study. Comparing the meta-analysis 
and the original UTAUT2 study, we found the strongest 
effects for habit (0.37 vs 0.24) and behavioral intention 
(0.20 vs 0.33), whereas the effect of facilitating conditions 
was weakest (0.15 vs 0.15). 
5.2.2 
Extending UTAUT: Behavioral 
Intention. 
The extended UTAUT, shown in Model 8, showed that 7 
out of 11 tested constructs were related to intention. More 
specifically, we found relationships for performance 
expectancy (β = 0.06), price value (β = 0.03) and habit (β = 
0.59) that have been proposed by Venkatesh et al. (2012). 
In addition, our meta-analysis suggests the inclusion of 
compatibility (β = 0.62) and education (β = 0.03). Personal 
innovativeness and technology costs were nonsignificant. 
Interestingly, the effects of UTAUT predictors effort 
expectancy and social influence were weak and showed a 
negative effect when the extension variables were included. 
The effect of performance expectancy was rather weak in 
the combined model (Model 8). The effect of effort 
expectancy became negative when compatibility was 
added (Model 2). Similarly, hedonic motivation became 
nonsignificant 
when 
compatibility 
was 
included. 
Facilitating conditions had weak or negative effects across 
all individual extensions (Models 2-5). Several of the new 
predictors explained intention across the various 
technologies and users examined in the meta-analysis.

Extending UTAUT: Use  
The revised UTAUT in Model 8 showed marginal 
effects of intention and facilitating conditions on use. 
Facilitating conditions became nonsignficant when 
including all extensions in the model. Habit is the only 
UTAUT predictor that showed a strong effect on use 
(β = 0.56). This effect was consistent in all tested 
models. Among the included new predictors, 
compatibility (β = 0.37), technology costs (β = -0.14), 
and personal innovativeness (β = 0.13) showed strong 
associations with use. The effect of education was 
marginal. Having a closer look at the individual 
extensions, we observe that intention loses importance 
when compatibility (Model 2) was included. The new 
predictors explain use better than several of the 
original UTAUT constructs.

5.3 
Results of Moderator Analysis 
The SEM results suggest that the effects of some 
UTAUT predictors became marginal when using data 
from all empirical UTAUT studies and including 
additional predictors. It seems that the original 
constructs do not have unconditional effects on intention 
and use. The moderator analysis helps to explain 
whether specific contexts exist when these UTAUT 
predictors are more likely to demonstrate the expected 
effect. Some UTAUT predictors show conditional 
effects in our meta-analysis. We report the moderator 
results for original UTAUT constructs and the different 
extensions in Table 4 for dichotomous moderators and 
in Table 5 for continuous moderators.6 For dichotomous 
moderators, we report the weighted and corrected 
correlations (rc) next to the moderator variable (rchigh 
moderator vs rclow moderator) and the correlation (r) between 
moderator variable and effect size for continuous 
moderators. Similar to Gerow et al. (2014), we 
complemented the subgroup results for dichotomous 
moderators in Table 4 with additional significance tests 
to examine differences across moderator levels.  
5.3.1 
UTAUT Predictors 
Results of the moderator tests in Tables 4 and 5 suggest 
that performance expectancy was more likely to 
influence use for transaction technologies than for non-
transaction technologies (H6a: rc = 0.57 vs. rc = 0.44, 
Table 4) and mobile than non-mobile technologies 
(H8a: 0.51 vs. 0.45). The relationship was stronger in 
high power distance cultures (r = 0.14, Table 5) and 
weaker in individualistic (H3a: -0.17) and masculine 
cultures (H4a: -0.10). Performance expectancy had 
stronger effects on behavorial intention in low power 
distance cultures (-0.05) and in individualistic cultures 
(H3a: 0.08). We discuss these and other moderating 
effects in Table 6. The moderator results also suggest 
that effort expectancy gained importance in predicting 
use for transaction vs. non-transaction technologies 
(0.46 vs. 0.35) and mobile vs. non-mobile technologies 
(H8b: 0.44 vs. 0.35). The relationship was stronger in 
high power distance cultures (0.16) and collectivistic 
cultures (H3d: -0.22). For the relationship between 
effort expectancy and behavioral intention, we observed 
moderating effects for mobile versus non-mobile 
technologies (H8b: 0.53 vs. 51); also, the relationship 
was stronger for feminine cultures (H4b: -0.09). Social 
influence gained importance in use for transaction 
technologies (0.42 vs. 0.30), internet technologies (H7c: 
0.34 vs. 0.27), mobile technologies (0.38 vs. 0.30), and 
collectivistic cultures (H3c: -0.12). It gained importance 
in predicting behavioral intention for transaction 
technologies (0.51 vs. 0.42), mobile technologies (0.52 
vs. 0.39), and collectivistic cultures (H3c: -0.12). We

full data set and Appendix O-P contrast results of the 
found that price value had stronger effects on use for 
high power distance cultures (0.33). There were no 
moderating effects for the relationship between price 
value and intention. Hedonic motivation had a stronger 
effect on use for transaction technologies (H6b: 0.51 vs 
0.36). It also had stronger effects on intention for 
transaction technologies (0.62 vs. 0.52). Facilitating 
conditions showed stronger effects on use for men  
(-0.19) and collectivistic cultures (-0.17); it showed 
stronger effects on intention for transaction technologies 
(H6d: 0.50 vs 0.38), mobile technologies (H8c: 0.53 vs. 
0.36), high power distance cultures (H2b: 0.14), 
collectivistic cultures (-0.14), and feminine cultures 
(H4d: -0.15). Finally, habit was a stronger predictor of 
use for internet technologies (0.59 vs. 0.31), high power 
distance cultures (0.51), and collectivistic cultures  
(-0.55); habit was a stronger predictor of intention for 
high power distance cultures (0.36), collectivistic cultures 
(-0.25), and low uncertainty avoidance cultures (-0.36). 
5.3.2 
UTAUT Extensions 
The effects of the four extensions (i.e., compatibility, 
education, personal innovativeness, and costs) on 
intention and use were moderated by study context. 
Compatibility with the user’s lifestyle had stronger effects 
on use for collectivistic cultures (-0.44); it also had 
stronger effects on intention for women (0.18). Education 
also showed some interaction effects. It showed stronger 
effects on use for women (0.64) and low uncertainty 
avoidance cultures (-0.71). It had stronger effects on 
intention 
in 
collectivistic 
cultures 
(-0.51). 
The 
relationship between personal innovativeness and use 
was stronger for transaction technologies (0.65 vs. 
0.28), younger users (-0.37), and collectivistic cultures 
(-0.42). Its relationship with intention was stronger for 
mobile technologies (0.43 vs. 0.28). Finally, technology 
costs showed stronger negative effects on use for 
transaction technologies (-0.41 vs. -0.19). Moreover, it 
showed stronger negative effects on intention for 
transaction technologies (-0.47 vs. -0.05), non-mobile 
technologies (-0.28 vs. -0.05), low power distance 
cultures (0.20), feminine cultures (0.23), and high 
uncertainty avoidance cultures (-0.28). 
Method Moderators: We also assessed the effects of 
study year and sampling approach. As expected, student 
samples were found to display stronger effect sizes than 
nonstudent samples for some relationships (e.g., 
facilitating conditions, social influence, and hedonic 
motivation). Also, we found numerous effects of study 
year, with effect sizes being stronger in recent years 
(e.g., performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and 
social influence). Similar moderating influences can be 
observed for other relationships. 
analyses with and without effect size outliers to display the 
differences across analyses.

a. The main effect of costs is negative and this is important to consider when interpreting the moderator results. 
Table 6. Interpretation of Moderator Results 
Moderator 
Results 
Interpretation 
Age 
Personal innovativeness was more 
relevant to younger users predicting 
use. No further differences were 
observed. 
• Personal innovativeness was important for younger users because their 
technology preferences have yet to be shaped (Spitzer, 2006; Rahi & 
Ghani, 2018).  
Women 
While education gained relevance for 
women when predicting use, 
facilitating conditions lost relevance. 
Compatibility gained relevance for 
women when predicting intention. 
• Women tend to display greater self-criticism, thus making education gain 
importance. They emphasize work-life balance, thus making compatibility 
with their values and past experiences gain relevance. 
• Women tend to view technology as a tool that can increase productivity, 
whereas men tend to view technology as more of a toy for fun (Bain & 
Rice, 2006). Men show greater interest in technology, making them want to 
interact more with the technology provider and use their support (Igbaria et 
al., 1991). 
Consumers 
We observed only marginal or 
nonsignificant effects of this 
moderator on the relationship between 
UTAUT predictors (H1a-H1f) and 
both behavioral intention and use.  
• There were few differences when UTAUT was applied in the context of 
consumer or employee use of technology.  
• UTAUT can be applied and generalized across studies that examine 
consumer or work-related contexts.  
Power 
distance 
The effects of effort expectancy, price 
value, and habit on use were stronger 
for countries with higher power 
distance. The effects of facilitating 
conditions (H2b) and habit on 
intention were stronger for countries 
with higher power distance, whereas 
the effect of costs was weaker. 
Performance expectancy was more 
relevant in predicting use in high 
power distance countries, whereas it 
was less so for behaviorial intention. 
No effect was observed for social 
influence (H2a). 
• In higher power distance cultures, individuals conform more and are less 
independent (Matusitz & Musambira, 2013). Users in high power distance 
cultures have greater expectations of the firm to support and enable 
technology use because the firm is perceived as being more powerful than 
in low power distance cultures; thus, effort expectancy, facilitating 
conditions, and price value were both important predictors. They seem to 
care less about the costs. 
• For the same reason, performance expectancy was more relevant in 
predicting use in high power distance countries; however, the weaker effect 
on intention is surprising.  
• Due to the greater reliance on powerful members of society (e.g., firms), 
users were more likely to develop a habit to use the technology. 
Individualism-
collectivism 
The effects of effort expectancy 
(H3d), social influence (H3c), 
facilitating conditions, habit, 
compatibility, and personal 
innovativeness on use were weaker

(Im et al., 2011) and use technology whose use is habitual, has high 
compatibility with existing technologies, and has a good set of facilitating 
conditions.

education on intention were weaker 
for individualistic countries. 
Performance expectancy (H3a) was 
weaker for individualistc countries in 
predicting use but it had a stronger 
effect on behavioral intention. No 
effect was observed for hedonic 
motivation (H3b). 
• In collectivistic cultures, people tend to follow others’ decisions. However, 
with greater personal innovativeness, they are more likely to seek 
information on their own and be more willing to be independent decision 
makers when deciding to use new technology (Lee et al., 2013).  
• In collectivistic cultures, where people will usually follow the norm, those 
who find technology easy to use will still decide to use a technology 
without conforming to others (Chong et al., 2012). It is more important 
that users have a good education.  
Masculinity-
femininity 
Performance expectancy (H4a) had a 
weaker effect on use in masculine 
culture countries. The effects of effort 
expectancy (H4b), facilitating 
conditions (H4d), and costs on 
intention were weaker in masculine 
culture countries. No effect was 
observed for social influence (H4c). 
• Users in masculine cultures are more likely to explore the use of 
technology and are more likely to be interested in performance 
accomplishments (Im et al., 2011). Thus, users reflect less on whether the 
technology would be challenging to use or not, and whether support is 
offered. Instead, they try the latest technology or try to use more complex 
functions to maintain an edge over others (Ma & Turel, 2019). 
• Interestingly, performance expectancy had a stronger effect in feminine 
cultures, suggesting that users in these cultures assess technology more 
critically and expect it to provide benefits to users. Users focus on feminine 
values such as quality of life (Huang et al., 2010), and hence cost of a new 
technology is important to them because users could spend the money in 
more pleasurable ways. 
Uncertainty 
avoidance 
The effect of education on use was 
weaker in high uncertainty avoidance 
countries. The effect of habit on 
intention was weaker in high 
uncertainty avoidance countries, 
whereas the effects of costs were 
stronger. No effects were observed for 
facilitating conditions (H5a), social 
influence (H5b), and effort 
expectancy (H5c). 
• In high uncertainty avoidance cultures, users do not tolerate uncertainty (Im 
et al., 2011); relying on technology costs (Lu et al., 2005) helps to cope 
with uncertainty because higher costs often imply better product quality 
(Agarwal & Teas, 2002).  
• Users from low uncertainty avoidance cultures do not need detailed 
technology information (Im et al., 2011); they are also going to use it once 
it becomes a habit for them. Interestingly, education gains importance in 
the use of technology in these cultures; some education may be needed to 
enjoy the use of technology. 
Transaction 
The effects of performance 
expectancy (H6a), effort expectancy, 
social influence, hedonic motivations 
(H6b), personal innovativeness, and 
costs on use were stronger for 
transaction technologies. The effects 
of social influence, hedonic 
motivations (H6b), facilitating 
conditions (H6d), and costs on 
intention were stronger for transaction 
technologies. No significant 
difference was found for habit (H6c). 
• Transaction technologies are associated with financial risks and users are 
more likely to use them if they find them useful and easy to use, with good 
facilitating conditions, and if people important to them also use the 
technology (Chong, 2013; Loh et al., 2021). Innovative users are also more 
likely to use the technology. Users also consider the cost of the 
transactional technology because it is an indicator for quality/secure 
transactions (Loh et al., 2021).  
• Users are also more likely to use transactional technology if they find it 
enjoyable, as the technology is often related to online shopping (Ramayah 
& Ignatius, 2005). 
Internet  
The effect of social influence (H7c) 
and habit on use were stronger for 
internet technologies. No effects were 
observed for effort expectancy (H7a) 
and facilitating condition (H7b).  
• Users employ online technologies, such as social media, to foster social 
relationships and engage in social comparisons.  
• Using the internet has now become a habit for most users, and it is being 
used for both work and daily life (Haythornthwaite & Wellman, 2002). 
Mobile 
The effects of performance 
expectancy (H8a), effort expectancy 
(H8b), and social influence on use 
gained importance for mobile 
technologies when compared to non-
mobile technologies. The effects of 
effort expectancy (H8b), social 
influence, facilitating conditions 
(H8c), and personal innovativeness on 
intention gained importance for 
mobile technologies; costs lost 
importance for mobile technologies. 
• Mobile technologies offer new service concepts to users causing the 
innovativeness trait to increase in relevance (Chong et al., 2012).  
• Mobile technologies improve connectivity, and people tend to use these 
technologies if their social circle and people who are important to them also 
use these technologies (Chong et al., 2012). 
• Mobile technologies are often consumer focused (Venkatesh et al., 2012). 
Consumers who enjoy using mobile technologies care less about cost. 
Mobile technologies are improving constantly making performance 
expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions gain importance 
(Hew et al., 2015).

6 Discussion 
Although UTAUT is a theory that is of great 
importance in IS, in recent times, there has been an 
increasing number of suggestions that research on 
UTAUT and other acceptance theories may have 
reached their limit regarding insights to be gained. 
Given the widespread misspecification of prior 
replications and extensions of this theory, and the 
narrow focus and limited database of prior meta-
analyses, the present work assessed whether UTAUT 
is a robust theory or whether a new UTAUT 
specification is in order. More specifically, our meta-
analysis clarified whether and which of the central 
tenets of UTAUT were supported. We then formulated 
a state-of-the-art, revised UTAUT that can guide future 
research. The revised UTAUT extended the theory 
with four additional predictors that were found to be 
more influential for many technologies than even some 
of the theory’s original predictors and UTAUT 2 
predictors. Also, UTAUT should be extended by 
considering additional contextual differences that 
characterize the specific context in which the theory is 
employed. The effects in the revised UTAUT depend 
not only on user characteristics as moderators, but also 
on national culture and technology type as moderators, 
thus underscoring the need for more cross-context 
UTAUT theorizing. 
6.1 
Theoretical Contributions 
Our results suggest that the current conceptualizations 
of UTAUT and UTAUT2 have limitations. The results 
suggest that four new predictor variables—i.e., 
technology compatibility, user education, personal 
innovativeness, and costs of technology—explain 
substantial variance in intention and use above and 
beyond the variance explained by current predictors. 
Our findings indicate that the new predictors cover 
aspects that are not considered either in UTAUT or 
UTAUT2. As such, when employing UTAUT in future 
technology studies, researchers should consider the 
revised UTAUT that includes these four new predictors. 
Despite advances in IT, technology compatibility 
remains an important issue for users or organizations 
that plan to adopt new technology. Often, when there is 
a new radical technological innovation, an organization 
may find it a challenge to embrace the new technology 
(Hill & Rothaermel, 2003). This is especially true when 
a new technology is part of an existing platform or 
ecosystem, or when an organization has made a strategic 
commitment to implementing a system with its partners 
(e.g., supply chain partners), thus making the adoption 
of the new technology highly inflexible.  
Although some demographic characteristics were used 
in prior UTAUT studies, user education and personal 
innovativeness were shown to be the most important 
user characteristics that can influence adoption 
decisions. Finally, we found that users consider the 
monetary cost of buying/using the technology to be 
important, both for consumer and organizational 
technologies. Like consumers, employees seem to 
consider the costs of technology, although employees 
may not need to pay for the technology themselves. 
Thus, it is important to incorporate the cost of 
technology in the theory even in organizational contexts. 
Our meta-analysis also suggests that several of the 
original UTAUT predictors show weaker effects when 
including new predictors, emphasizing the relative 
importance of new predictors. Without considering these 
four predictors, scholars cannot fully understand the 
factors determining technology use. We identified these 
factors using a systematic approach that considered a 
large number of potential (extension) variables. 
Although prior research on UTAUT has assessed 
additional predictors on an ad hoc basis usually by testing 
one additional predictor, our meta-analysis found that the 
new predictors outperform the alternative (extension) 
variables (Appendices J-K). Our meta-analysis thereby 
clarified which of the potential extensions should be 
considered in future UTAUT studies. Interestingly, the 
new predictors mainly relate to users and their personal 
circumstances. These findings contribute to the debate 
about the importance of user-oriented technology design 
versus selecting the “right” users. It seems that user 
characteristics explain more variance in technology use 
than technology beliefs do. 
Moreover, synthesizing the research across numerous 
study contexts, our meta-analysis found substantial 
variance in the UTAUT relationships. This variance in 
relationships suggests the presence of moderating 
variables exerting an influence. This is an important 
finding because it has been common practice to only 
examine the main effects in UTAUT, while neglecting 
contextual differences and moderator effects. This result 
also suggests that there is not just one UTAUT 
specification with a universal set of predictors that 
applies to all contexts. Instead, the theory’s ability to 
predict technology use depends on the specific context. 
Although we found that some relationships in the 
revised UTAUT are generalizable across users, 
technologies, and cultures, most relationships differ in 
strength across these contexts and they are not easily 
generalizable (many relationships with intention and use 
are moderated; Tables 4 and 5). This finding also 
emphasizes the need for the importance of cross-context 
theorizing when trying to understand technology use. 
Thus, scholars should always consider moderators when 
applying UTAUT and they can also use the results of the 
moderator tests to compare their findings with ours. 
Scholars can use our findings to explain why certain 
predictors turn out to be less important in their studies.  
More specifically, our meta-analysis found contextual 
differences not only across user types, but also across 
different technology types—i.e., mobile vs. non-mobile,

Meta-Analysis of UTAUT

online vs. offline, and transaction vs. non-transaction. 
We classified the large number of technologies 
examined in prior UTAUT research using this broad 
classification. As expected, there was a wide range of 
technologies studied in prior research. In our research, 
because of the exploratory nature of our meta-analysis, 
we were able to group previous technologies studied in 
UTAUT into different categories. Despite the many 
types of technologies examined by UTAUT, the three 
types of technologies were found to have substantial 
contextual differences, thus providing us clearer insights 
into the boundary conditions of the theory. Although 
some 
UTAUT 
studies 
have 
previously 
tested 
technology differences, the employed technology type 
variables were too narrow to cover all types of 
technologies. The revised UTAUT shows the benefits of 
employing 
a 
widely 
applicable 
technology 
classification. 
Thus, 
scholars 
can 
use 
this 
comprehensive classification to compose a UTAUT 
specification that predicts technology use in different 
contexts. Although the two key predictors, i.e., 
performance expectancy and effort expectancy, were 
found to have relatively weak effects across many 
technology types, these two variables gain importance 
in the context of mobile technologies. Thus, studies 
examining mobile technologies should focus on these 
variables. Similar conclusions can be drawn for other 
technology types (i.e., internet technologies and 
transaction technologies). 
National culture also must be considered when using 
UTAUT because culture variables moderate key 
UTAUT relationships, as indicated by the number of 
significant moderation effects in our moderator tests. 
Since prior research had conducted simple two-country 
comparisons, scholars are aware of the importance of 
cultural differences. Our work builds on such prior 
research and clarifies which specific culture variables 
speak to the contextualization of UTAUT. We found 
that all four culture dimensions proposed by Hofstede 
(2001) exert a moderating effect. Most cultural 
differences 
were 
observed 
for 
individualism-
collectivism and power distance, but some differences 
were also observed for masculinity-femininity and 
uncertainty avoidance. Scholars can use these findings 
to tailor UTAUT for different cultures. For example, in 
highly collectivistic cultures, such as South Korea, 
certain predictors, such as effort expectancy, social 
influence, and education gain importance. Again, 
scholars can use these results to retrospectively explain 
why certain predictors show weaker effects in a specific 
study. Certain predictors may display weaker effects in 
a specific cultural setting due to user socialization.  
We also observe that many UTAUT predictors show 
stronger effects in later studies applying this theory 
compared to early studies. Venkatesh and Bala (2008) 
explained that as users gain more experience with 
technology, various factors related to the specific 
technology (i.e., adjustment factors) gain importance 
(see also Venkatesh, 2000). Since many UTAUT factors 
have been found to vary over time, it seems that 
experiences with various technologies are transferable 
without difficulty to a specific technology, thus making 
the user adjustment effect rather strong.  
Key conclusions from our results are summarized in 
Table 7. Figure 1 shows the revised UTAUT that 
complements the current UTAUT specification with four 
additional predictors and considers further moderators 
characterizing the study context. This revised theory 
explains more variance in intention and use than UTAUT 
and UTAUT2 do. This theory also provides detailed 
insights into the contextual importance of the eleven 
predictors explaining behavioral intention and use and 
provides insights into the generalizability of this theory. 
6.2 
Scientific Implications 
Our meta-analysis seeks to shed new light on directions 
for research that can continue to enhance the 
understanding of technology adoption and UTAUT. 
Table 8 summarizes our key recommendations for 
future research, and we elaborate on them here. First, 
scholars should examine theoretically meaningful 
predictors. Our meta-analysis found habit to be the most 
important predictor among the set of original predictors. 
Although the literature differentiates between types of 
user behavior, they have received little attention thus far. 
Users may purchase technologies impulsively because 
of a sudden urge or use technology because of addiction. 
A recent meta-analysis on consumer impulse formation 
identified key predictors and psychological processes 
that led to an individual’s urge to engage in impulsive 
behavior (Iyer et al., 2020). Such literature is helping in 
extending UTAUT to include impulsive technology use. 
Similarly, compulsive behavior is another stream in 
consumer research that scholars should examine to 
further extend UTAUT. Research is also needed on 
situational predictors of technology—for example, 
whether the user is alone when using technology or 
whether a friend or family member observes, helps, or 
participates in the technology use. Other situational 
factors may be the user’s monetary budget restrictions 
and time pressure. It would be interesting to assess the 
interplay between these restrictions and other predictors 
such as the user’s impulsiveness to use technology.  
Second, research should pay more attention to 
variables at the group/organization level. Most 
extensions considered in various UTAUT studies are 
based on individual-level theories. However, scholars 
should assess whether individual-level predictors 
impact outcomes of technology use at other levels such 
as the group level (e.g., team performance) and firm 
level (e.g., firm performance).

Finding 
Recommendation 
UTAUT predictors and outcomes 
1. The original UTAUT and UTAUT2 predictors 
are related to intention and use, but the effects 
are weaker than expected. 
• Scholars should use the full set of UTAUT variables, whenever possible; 
excluding some predictors may yield inaccurate findings related to the 
relative importance of different predictors of use.  
• However, scholars can use the moderator results to assess when specific 
predictors are more important than others in different contexts. 
2. Results in Table 3 suggest that four new 
predictors explain substantial variance in use. 
• UTAUT studies should include technology compatibility, user education, 
personal innovativeness, and costs of technology as predictors because they 
are more important than most original predictors. 
3. The new predictors were identified in a 
systematic testing approach assessing 23 
potential extensions in several SEMs. 
• Scholars should include the four new predictors rather than the other tested 
extensions (Appendices J-K) because they are more likely to explain use. 
4. Inclusion of new predictors makes some original 
UTAUT predictors lose importance.  
• This finding implies that the new predictors are of unconditional importance, 
whereas the original predictors are of conditional importance. 
Contextualization of UTAUT research 
5. We found substantial variation in effect sizes 
(Table 1) that can be explained by moderators 
(Tables 4 and 5). 
• This finding stresses that UTAUT studies should always consider contextual 
differences, requiring cross-contextual theorizing. The minimum expectation 
is that studies include the individual characteristics as moderators (i.e., age 
and gender).  
6. We found several interaction effects between 
three technology types and UTAUT predictors 
(Table 4). 
• Studies testing a larger number of different technologies should use the 
technology types (mobile technology, online technology, and transaction 
technology) as moderators. 
• Scholars can also use the results of our moderator tests to explain 
contradictory findings in their own research. It may be that one predictor is 
less important in their study due to the examined technology type.

Finding 
Recommendation 
7. We found UTAUT effects to depend on four 
culture variables (power distance, individualism-
collectivism, masculinity-femininity, and 
uncertainty avoidance; Table 5). 
• Research should consider the country and the four corresponding culture 
variables when interpreting their results. User socialization in a specific 
culture impacts technology perception and use. National culture may explain 
the varying importance of predictors in different studies. 
8. The importance of some UTAUT predictors 
varies over time (Table 5). 
• Scholars should consider the time at which a specific technology is available 
to users. Many UTAUT predictors gained importance over time. 
Table 8. Research Agenda on UTAUT 
Issues 
Key illustrative recommendations 
Examine 
theoretically 
meaningful 
predictors 
• Assess drivers that characterize impulsive behavior (e.g., urge to use technology)  
• Test drivers that characterize compulsive behavior (e.g., internet addiction) 
• Assess situational predictors in UTAUT (e.g., user alone or accompanied, time-pressure, financial 
restrictions) 
• Test interactions between predictors (e.g., user traits, such as impulsiveness, and situational predictors 
such as financial resources) 
Expand the focus 
on variables at 
higher levels (e.g., 
group, 
organization) 
• Examine the effects of individual-level variables (e.g., technology use) on outcomes at a higher level 
(e.g., organization’s competitive advantage, firm performance) 
• Assess cross-level direct effects of variables residing at higher levels, such as the team (e.g., leadership 
style, team composition, team climate) or organization (firm resources, dynamic capabilities), as 
predictors of use  
• Test interactions between higher-level predictors (e.g., leadership style) and lower-level moderators 
(user innovativeness) 
• Theorize more complex interaction effects such as between collectivism in a country (culture) and 
economic situation (GDP) 
• Assess multilevel mediation between user characteristics on technology use and then, the impact of 
technology use on firm performance 
• Examine more levels of analysis, including individuals, dyads, teams, businesses, corporations, and 
industries 
Use novel theories 
to understand 
UTAUT 
mechanisms 
• Examine formation of new predictors like personal innovativeness (e.g., abstract traits impact specific 
traits; Mowen, 2000) 
• Examine established predictors (e.g., whether firms can encourage habit formation by offering 
incentives for use) 
Use novel theories 
to extend outcomes 
of technology use 
• Identify nontraditional outcomes variables from transformative research (e.g., literacy, decreasing 
disparity, health, happiness) 
• Differentiate between assimilation, diffusion, and routinization of use  
• Assess curvilinear effects in UTAUT (e.g., optimal stimulation level theory suggests such effects for 
hedonic motivation) 
Use novel theories 
to extend the range 
of mediators and 
moderators 
• Use novel theories from other fields to study mediators (e.g., brand equity, customer experience, 
customer engagement; Brakus et al., 2009; Hollebeek et al., 2019). 
• Employ theories from international business research to assess novel moderators (e.g., concept of 
cross-national differences; Swoboda et al., 2016) 
• Use theories considering the heterogeneity of users in countries (e.g., country’s ethnic, linguistic, and 
religious diversity) 
Broaden the 
conceptualization 
and 
operationalization 
of key variables 
• Broaden conceptualization of predictors (e.g., different types of lifestyles and habits) 
• Broaden conceptualization of moderators (e.g., identification of users with multiple cultural 
affiliations; culture concept proposed by Triandis and Gelfand, 1998)  
• Employ broader technology classifications (e.g., location-sensitivity of service, time criticality of 
service, and control of service recipient; Balasubramanian et al., 2002) 
• Test new technology classifications (e.g., based on goal-directed systems and task-technology fit 
literature) 
Investigate 
changing 
importance of 
predictors 
• Assess whether UTAUT specifications differ for initial use compared to various levels of experience, 
especially over longer time windows  
Use different 
research designs 
• Sample and study theoretically meaningful technologies (e.g., anthropomorphism of chat bots and 
social robots) 
• Employ more observational studies and qualitative studies; employ latent growth modeling to study 
longitudinal effects

41 
Similarly, group-level predictors (e.g., team composition) 
and firm-level predictors (e.g., manager’s leadership 
style) may influence technology outcomes at the 
individual level. Studies should examine cross-level 
moderation effects as well as multilevel mediation. 
Organizational studies have stressed that multilevel 
theories can help to overcome the division of micro- and 
macro-camps in organizational research. These theories 
typically describe “some combination of individuals, 
dyads, teams, businesses, corporations, and industries” 
(Klein et al., 1999, p. 243). Such theories may provide IS 
scholars with a deeper and richer portrait of technology 
use and help link constructs that were previously unlinked 
in IS literature, such as individual-level technology use 
predictors and organizational-level outcomes like 
competitive advantage and firm performance.  
Third, scholars are encouraged to better understand 
UTAUT mechanisms. Our meta-analysis suggests four 
new predictors that should be added to UTAUT. These 
new 
endogenous 
mechanisms, 
i.e., 
technology 
compatibility, user education, personal innovativeness, 
and costs of technology, have important implications for 
future research. These four predictors relate to different 
theories that could be used by scholars to deepen our 
understanding of technology adoption. For example, 
more research is needed on the antecedents of the four 
mechanisms, and trait theory is a fruitful way to provide 
insights on how traits like personal innovativeness form 
and change. It is important to understand how key traits 
evolve and which other user traits may have an influence 
on technology use. Mowen’s (2000) 3M model of 
motivation and personality may be interesting to 
consider, including hierarchical personality models 
assuming that more abstract, cross-situational traits 
impact narrow situation-specific behavioral tendencies 
of an individual that then influence behavior—here, 
technology use. Similarly, more research is needed about 
the process of habit formation and whether firms can 
contribute to this process.  
Fourth, we encourage scholars to extend research on 
the outcomes of technology use. Most of the collected 
studies examine intention and use. It seems promising 
to also examine the influence of UTAUT predictors on 
other outcome variables. Transformative research 
suggests that technology has the potential to contribute 
to users’ well-being. Thus, it may be interesting to 
examine nontraditional outcomes emphasized in this 
literature stream (e.g., literacy, decreasing disparity, 
health, happiness). Also, future research should 
examine assimilation, diffusion, and routinization of 
technology use, which have been little examined in 
studies that have employed UTAUT although they are 
reasonably well researched in adoption studies at the 
organizational level. It is also worth examining 
 
7 Ethnic fractionalization reflects the number of different 
ethnic groups, languages, and religions in one country. 
whether the predictors display curvilinear effects on 
these outcomes, as has been shown with some of the 
UTAUT predictors on individual-level outcomes (e.g., 
Brown et al., 2012, 2014; Venkatesh & Goyal, 2010).  
Fifth, the study of novel mediators and moderators is 
a promising avenue for future research. One interesting 
mediator discussed in recent IS research and related 
literature is the brand equity of the firm (e.g., Xu et al., 
2014). Managers often introduce technology not only 
to provide services to users, but also to improve the 
firm’s brand image. Technology use may improve 
brand equity, which in turn impacts brand loyalty. 
Other novel mediators may be customer experience 
(sensory, affective, behavioral, intellectual; Brakus et 
al., 2009) and customer engagement (cognitive, 
affective, behavioral—Hollebeek et al., 2019). 
Regarding moderators, scholars could draw from 
theories in related fields. The concept of cross-national 
differences may be useful in this context. This concept 
suggests that country markets differ regarding several 
characteristics that have the potential to impact the 
importance of different predictors in the revised 
UTAUT to explain use (Swoboda et al., 2016). 
According to Berry et al. (2010), these differences 
include factors like (1) economic factors, (2) 
legislative system, (3) composition of the country’s 
population, and (4) political system. Studies should 
also examine the interplay between predictors in the 
revised UTAUT model and a country’s heterogeneity 
measuring the ethnic, linguistic, and religious 
fractionalization in the country on behavioral intention 
and technology use.7 For example, it may be that social 
influence had weaker effects on use in diverse 
countries because societal ties between different 
groups are weaker. Also, it may be more difficult to 
communicate the performance benefits of technology 
in more diverse countries making performance 
expectancy lose importance as a predictor of use in 
diverse countries. Also, we noticed that many UTAUT 
studies do not report information on voluntariness of 
technology use. Appropriate reporting and testing of 
this moderator are essential in order to accurately test 
the theory and the situational contingency (i.e., 
voluntariness) specified in it.  
Sixth, more research is needed to broaden the 
conceptualization of predictors and moderators. 
Related literature suggests various conceptualizations 
of key UTAUT predictors. Scholars should test 
alternative measurements of these predictors. For 
instance, our findings suggest that the four new 
predictors relate to user characteristics (i.e., education 
and personal innovativeness) and their personal 
circumstances (i.e., compatibility with lifestyle and 
costs of technology). It may be interesting to

differentiate not only different types of user lifestyles 
that may vary across the user’s private and work life, 
but also different social groups with which the user 
identifies. Similar extensions should be assessed for 
other user characteristics. With respect to moderators, 
we suggest incorporating more research and theories 
from cross-cultural psychology. While existing 
research on culture and technology use stresses the 
importance of national culture for understanding user 
behavior, this research stream would greatly benefit 
from examining more novel conceptualizations of 
culture. Culture can generally be measured not only at 
the national level, similar to the present meta-analysis, 
but also at the individual user level (Rai et al., 2009). 
These cultural orientations of users may be better 
suited to explaining variance in UTAUT relationships 
than national culture is. Lenartowicz and Roth (2001, 
p. 150) explained that individual cultural orientations 
predict individual behavior better than national culture 
“unless collective cultural values are strongly shared 
by the members of the cultural group” (see Hoehle et 
al., 2015). Related to this, Triandis and Gelfand (1998) 
distinguished 
between 
different 
individual-level 
cultural orientations including horizontal and vertical 
individualism and collectivism. Currently, it is also 
common for users to belong to and be influenced by 
more than one culture (multiculturalism) rather than 
just one culture (monoculturalism). Further, scholars 
should develop novel technology classifications. Our 
meta-analysis extends Meuter et al.’s (2000) 
classification and uses it to explain variance in 
different UTAUT relationships. We encourage 
scholars to engage in more cross-contextual research 
by collecting data covering a larger number of 
technologies and starting to classify them, given that 
the classification used in our meta-analysis seems to be 
useful 
in 
explaining 
variations 
in 
UTAUT 
relationships. Scholars should build on work on goal-
directed systems and task-technology fit to develop 
more nuanced classifications of technology types 
(Novak et al., 2003; Goodhue & Thompson, 1995)  
Seventh, more research is needed on the changing 
importance of predictors over time. Although 
longitudinal studies are proposed, as well as collecting 
data for behavioral intention and use, not many studies 
are doing it. One promising area to study would be how 
UTAUT predictors change over time during the 
lifecycle of users’ experiences with technology, 
especially over longer time horizons compared to what 
is typical (e.g., about five months in Venkatesh et al., 
2003). Research should assess whether we need a 
specification of UTAUT for various stages of use 
beyond the conceptualization of experience and its 
impact on UTAUT relationships, as reported in 
Venkatesh et al. (2003) and Venkatesh et al. (2012). 
The role of time (Venkatesh et al., 2006; Venkatesh et 
al., 2021), with latent growth modeling as one 
approach (e.g., Bala & Venkatesh, 2013) could be used 
to enrich our understanding. 
Finally, scholars are encouraged to use different 
research designs in their studies. UTAUT would 
benefit from using a purposeful sampling approach to 
examine theoretically interesting study participants 
and technologies not covered in the meta-analysis. For 
example, future research could apply and extend the 
revised UTAUT when studying the acceptance of 
novel technologies such as chat bots or social robots. 
Studies could examine the specific characteristics of 
chat bots and social robots (e.g., anthropomorphism, 
negative 
attitude 
toward 
robots) 
as 
predictors/moderators in UTAUT. Using qualitative 
studies may provide further insights into the surprising 
moderating effects found in this meta-analysis, thus 
helping us discover reasons for these patterns (for 
mixed methods research guidelines, see Creswell, 
2002; Venkatesh et al., 2016a; Venkatesh et al., 2013). 
7 Conclusion 
Our meta-analysis synthesizes research on UTAUT to 
assess the robustness of this theory and assess the 
inclusion of important variables, predictors, and 
moderators. Our findings highlight that the theory is 
less robust than it is often assumed to be. We assessed 
the impact of 23 potential extensions using SEM, and 
found UTAUT to benefit from the inclusion of four 
new endogenous mechanisms from different theories 
(i.e., technology compatibility, user education, 
personal innovativeness, and costs of technology). 
Inclusion of these predictors makes some of the 
original predictors lose importance. Moreover, we 
contribute to a better understanding about the 
generalizability and concomitant contextualization of 
UTAUT in different contexts by identifying various 
moderators (e.g., technology type, national culture). 
We use the insights gained from this comprehensive 
synthesis of extant research to arrive at a new UTAUT 
specification. Against this backdrop, we present 
directions for future research that can continue to 
enhance UTAUT and leverage it meaningfully.

Meta-Analysis of UTAUT 
 
60 
1. Data Collection 
When collecting the data for this meta-analysis, we used several criteria to decide whether to include a specific study. First, the study had to be empirical (e.g., survey, 
experiment or both) at the individual (e.g., user/employee) level of analysis. Thus, we excluded qualitative papers that applied UTAUT (e.g., Li, 2010; Ye et al., 2008), 
those that are conceptual or reviewed UTAUT literature (e.g., Bhatti et al., 2017), and empirical studies at other levels of analysis (e.g., Brown et al., 2010; Neufeld, Dong, 
& Higgins, 2007). Studies had to use at least one of the four main predictors of UTAUT in the study to be included in the meta-analysis. Studies that referred to the theory 
but did not measure any of its constructs were excluded from the meta-analysis (e.g., Angst & Agarwal, 2009; Benbasat & Barki, 2007). A total of 9,444 studies (83.64% 
of 11,291 screened articles) did not meet this criterion. Second, correlation coefficients had to be reported in these papers between constructs. If the information was not 
presented, we examined if there are other statistics that could be used to calculate these effect sizes (e.g., regression coefficients, t-values). If these or other statistics were 
not available in the article, we emailed authors to see whether they have such information that they can send to us. Another 354 studies (19.17% of 1,847 screened articles) 
were excluded because they did not report sufficient data (e.g., Debuse et al., 2008; van Setten et al., 2006). Third, the article had to provide an independent dataset (Gerow 
et al., 2014). Therefore, if the authors had articles that contained the same dataset, they were excluded to avoid biasing the study through multiple counting (Gerow et al., 
2014). We excluded 43 studies (2.88% of 1,493 screened articles) due to this criterion (e.g., Hu et al., 2009; Xu, 2014). The process of identifying, screening, and including 
studies is illustrated in Figure D1. 
2. Classification of Effect Sizes 
When classifying effects sizes, coders were given construct definitions and aliases (Appendix E). Hunter and Schmidt (2004, p. 470) explain that: “Initially, meta-analyses 
in a given research area should probably be narrow and focused enough to correspond to the major constructs recognized by researchers in that area. Then, as understanding 
develops, later meta-analyses may become broader in scope if that is shown to be theoretically appropriate.” Cooper (2017) adds to this discussion and argues that when 
the definition is too narrow, meaningful studies are likely to be left out. The present meta-analysis uses a rather narrow definition of key constructs. Because our meta-
analysis focuses on UTAUT, the constructs included in the meta-analysis measure core variables in this theory (e.g., performance expectancy). However, we also included 
studies that examined usefulness and treated this construct as an alias because performance expectancy and usefulness have the same roots and are treated as conceptually 
identical (see Venkatesh et al., 2003). We did the same for the other UTAUT variables. Excluding usefulness from the meta-analysis would give an incomplete picture of 
the importance of UTAUT drivers. For the UTAUT extensions, we initially differentiated across 72 different extension variables when coding and classifying variables 
for the meta-analysis to ensure that the constructs’ definitions are sufficiently narrow. 
3. Coding of Study Moderators 
For 1,236 of 1,935 samples, we could collect information about the user’s average age. Similarly, gender information was coded for 1,484 samples, and country information 
was coded for 1,808 samples. Our meta-analysis covers 77 countries including Abu Dhabi, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guinea, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, 
Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Macao, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Mexico, Mozambique, Netherlands, New Zealand, 
Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Peru, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, South 
Korea, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, 
Vietnam, and Yemen. We used Hofstede’s (2001) cultural dimensions to describe these countries’ cultural profiles. The coded studies also covered different technologies. 
Two coders assessed these technology contexts. The overall agreement rate was 98% for (i.e., 96% for mobile technology, 99% for online technology, and 99% for 
transaction technology). They used the following definitions when classifying technologies. Mobile technologies refer to “the application of small, portable and wireless 
computing and communication devices, including laptops with wireless LAN technology, mobile phones, and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) with Bluetooth, which 
let consumers utilize various internet services anytime and anywhere” (Park & Yang, 2006, p. 24; Balasubramanian et al., 2002). Internet technologies refer to “web-based 
communication technologies – such as browsers, websites, search engines, online forums, e-mail, blogs, and wikis – that enable the easy exchange and retrieval of digitised 
content” (Whelan et al., 2010, p. 401). Finally, transaction technologies “enables customers to order, buy, and exchange resources with companies … [Examples] are

Charles Schwab’s online trading service, Amazon.com, and the SABRE Group’s Travelocity, an internet-based travel ticketing service” (Meuter et al., 2000, p. 52). While 
439 samples examined mobile technologies, 1,496 samples examined non-mobile technologies. In 1,410 samples, the technology was examined in an online context, 
whereas in 525 samples, technology was examined in an offline setting. Finally, in 271 samples, the researchers examined technologies supporting transactions between 
the buyer and seller, whereas in 1,664 samples, non-transaction technologies were examined. 
4. Coding for Additional Moderators 
We considered examining two more moderators: (1) long-term orientation of culture and (2) voluntariness of technology use. First, various meta-analyses from different 
fields still use only the four culture dimensions—i.e., excluding long-term orientation—to assess the impact of cultural differences on an individual’s behavior. For 
example, Samaha, Beck, and Palmatier (2014) used the four dimensions to assess the role of culture in international relationship marketing, likewise, Blut et al. (2015) 
examined the impact of the four original culture dimensions on the perception of website characteristics; and Pick and Eisend (2016) similarly examined switching costs. 
These studies focused on the four original culture dimensions because of their representation in the literature. For this reason, we did not hypothesize any effects of long-
term orientation in our meta-analysis and also used the original culture dimensions. However, we still explored the moderating effects of long-term orientation and found 
performance expectancy (r =0.10), effort expectancy (r = 0.11), hedonic motivation (r = 0.20), compatibility (r = 0.44), and personal innovativeness (r = 0.45) showed 
stronger effects on use in high long-term orientation cultures. Social influence (r = 0.07) and education (r = 0.36) also showed stronger effects on intention in high long-
term orientation cultures, whereas hedonic motivation (r = -0.12) and compatibility (r = -0.21) showed weaker effects. It seems that users in high long-term orientation 
cultures are more considerate of technology use and place greater emphasis on many predictors. Second, we considered testing voluntariness of technology use. However, 
we decided against it. Venkatesh et al. (2012) argued that this moderator is less relevant for consumer technologies when they developed UTAUT2. They excluded 
voluntariness from this theory arguing that “relative to the original conceptualization of UTAUT, we drop voluntariness as a moderating variable. This change is 
necessary to make UTAUT applicable in the context of a voluntary behavior, such as the one we are studying (i.e., voluntary technology acceptance and use among 
consumers). While in general, voluntariness can be perceived as a continuum from absolutely mandatory to absolutely voluntary, consumers have no organizational 
mandate and thus, most consumer behaviors are completely voluntary, resulting in no variance in the voluntariness construct” (Venkatesh et al., 2012, p. 159). As our 
meta-analysis includes many consumer technologies, we removed voluntariness as a relevant construct from the model. Also, we examined how many of the collected 
studies reported information about mandatory versus voluntary technology use. Most studies did not report this information and where the information is provided the 
description is often vague. We found that 65% of all studies (e.g., Abdullah et al., 2016) did not report any information on this moderator. 5% of studies (e.g., El Ouirdi 
et al., 2016) indicated that the use context includes both voluntary and mandatory use. Many studies did not clearly explain whether the context is voluntary or not. 
Around 22% of the studies (e.g., Miltgen et al., 2013) mentioned the voluntariness of technology use. A number of studies even measured it as a continuum ranging 
from voluntary to mandatory use. Only, 8% of studies (Kim et al., 2016) examined mandatory use contexts. Given that there is a lack of sufficient data accurately 
reporting whether the technologies studied were in a voluntary or mandatory context, it was also not practical to include them in our meta-analysis. Meta-analyses are 
frequently used to comment on analysis and reporting practices in the examined research domain. Thus, we have explained in the discussion section that given that 
majority of UTAUT studies did not report sufficient information on voluntariness of technology use, future studies should report and test this traditional moderator to 
conduct a more accurate and complete test of the theory. 
5. Integration of Effect Sizes 
The more recent meta-analyses do not use Fisher z-transformation when integrating effect sizes. It is argued that this transformation overestimates true effect sizes by 15-
45% (Field, 2001). Hence, we also do not use this transformation. When calculating the integrated effect sizes, we also tested the statistical power of our tests. Statistical 
power is described as the probability of not rejecting a false null hypothesis (Type II error, defined by ) and it is therefore defined as (1–). It is interpreted as the 
probability that a statistical test will correctly reject a false null hypothesis. Muncer et al. (2003) propose that a test has sufficient power to detect meaningful effect sizes 
if power values are larger than 0.5.

6. Testing Publication Bias  
Nearly all significant relationships were found to be robust against publication bias. In a few cases, the FSN is lower than the tolerance level mainly because of only a few 
observations being available (i.e., visibility, income, tenure). The average file-drawer N across all individual relationships is 927,688 for behavioral intention and 87,151 
for use. Thus, in most cases, the tolerance criterion suggested by Rosenthal (1979) is fulfilled. The χ2 test of homogeneity is significant in most cases, supporting 
heterogeneity.  
7. Results of Power Tests 
We tested the power in our meta-analysis using two different sample sizes (N). We used the cumulative sample size N to calculate the power. The results of the power 
tests exceed the 0.5 level, suggesting that our analyses have sufficient power (Ellis, 2010).  
8. Results of Moderator Analysis 
In addition to the moderators discussed in the main text, we tested whether the quality of the publication outlet affects the results. We used a comprehensive journal ranking 
to split the studies into two groups and used this dummy variable to explore differences (Academic Journal Guide 2015). The results did not show any differences between 
the analyses.
