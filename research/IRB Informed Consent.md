Description of the Research and Participation
You are invited to participate in a research study conducted by Fabio Correa, a doctoral candidate in the Doctor of Business Administration program at Touro University Worldwide. The purpose of this study is to understand how individual, psychological, and contextual factors influence employee readiness to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the enterprise workplace. This study explores constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and AI-specific enablers and inhibitors, including trust in AI, explainability, perceived ethical risk, and AI-related anxiety.
Your participation will involve completing an online survey that takes approximately 10–15 minutes. The survey includes questions about your experiences and perceptions of AI tools, such as Microsoft 365 Copilot, ChatGPT, and other AI applications. Participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw at any time without penalty or consequence. Your decision to withdraw will be fully respected.

All data will be collected anonymously and stored securely to minimize confidentiality risks.

Potential Benefits
