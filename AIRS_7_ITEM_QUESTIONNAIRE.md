## Scoring Instructions

### Composite Score Calculation
1. **Sum all responses**: Add the values from items 1-7
2. **Calculate mean**: Divide sum by 7
3. **Range**: 1.00 (lowest readiness) to 5.00 (highest readiness)

### Score Interpretation
- **1.00 - 2.33**: Low AI Readiness
- **2.34 - 3.66**: Moderate AI Readiness
- **3.67 - 5.00**: High AI Readiness

### Individual Item Interpretation
Each item measures a specific dimension of AI readiness:
- **HM2**: Interest and engagement with AI
- **PV2**: Perceived value vs. effort
- **PE2**: Quality improvement expectations
- **TR2**: Trust in available AI tools
- **VO1**: Autonomous motivation (not mandated)
- **HB1**: Habitual use patterns
- **SI1**: Social encouragement and support

## Validation Summary

### Psychometric Properties
- **Internal Consistency**: α = 0.939 [95% CI: 0.928, 0.948] - Excellent
- **Mean Inter-Item Correlation**: r̄ = 0.664 - Strong cohesion
- **Convergent Validity**: r = 0.946 with full 24-item scale (89.4% shared variance)
- **Criterion Validity**: r = 0.776 with Behavioral Intention (60.2% variance explained)
- **Factor Structure**: Unidimensional (73.6% variance in Factor 1, KMO = 0.932)
- **Sample Size**: N = 309 complete cases

### Construct Coverage
The 7-item form covers **7 distinct theoretical constructs**:
1. **Hedonic Motivation (HM)** - UTAUT2 core construct
2. **Price Value (PV)** - UTAUT2 core construct
3. **Performance Expectancy (PE)** - UTAUT2 core construct
4. **Trust (TR)** - AI-specific extension
5. **Voluntariness (VO)** - Contextual extension
6. **Habit (HB)** - UTAUT2 core construct
7. **Social Influence (SI)** - UTAUT2 core construct

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Administration Time**: ~70 seconds vs. 240 seconds (full scale)
- **Time Reduction**: 71% decrease
- **Items**: 7 vs. 24 (71% fewer items)
- **Validity Retention**: 92.6% of full scale's criterion validity
- **Incremental Validity**: Full scale adds only ΔR² = 0.048 beyond 7-item form

### Recommended Use Cases
✅ **Academic Research**: Theory development, construct validation
✅ **Organizational Assessment**: Balanced coverage with efficiency
✅ **Stakeholder Reporting**: Provides construct-level insights
✅ **General Surveys**: When both breadth and brevity are important

### Alternative: 5-Item Ultra-Short Form
For maximum efficiency (79% time reduction, r = 0.799 with BI), consider the 5-item form:
- HM2, PV2, PE2, HM1, PV1

## Technical Notes

### Data Quality Recommendations
- **Attention Check**: Consider including an attention check item (e.g., "To show you are paying attention, please select 'Disagree'")
- **Response Time Monitoring**: Flag responses completed in < 30 seconds as potentially careless
- **Missing Data**: Handle via listwise deletion or multiple imputation (not recommended with < 10% missing)

### Statistical Analysis Recommendations
- **Reliability**: Report Cronbach's α with 95% confidence intervals
- **Validity**: Test convergent and criterion validity in your sample
- **Factor Analysis**: Confirm unidimensional structure (EFA/CFA)
- **Norms**: Develop context-specific norms for your population

### Sample Size Guidelines
- **Minimum for reliability analysis**: N ≥ 100
- **Recommended for factor analysis**: N ≥ 200
- **Ideal for structural modeling**: N ≥ 300
