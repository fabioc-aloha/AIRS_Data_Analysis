## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANALYSIS_PLAN.md` | Master implementation guide for the three-model analysis approach |
| `ANALYSIS_PLAN_WITH_RESULTS.md` | Historical archive with previous results (reference only) |
| `AIRS DBA Project Proposal v4.md` | Dissertation proposal with theoretical framework |

## Analysis Strategy

The current approach uses a **three-model strategy**:
- **Full Sample** (N ≈ 509) — Primary model for maximum statistical power
- **Academic Subsample** (N ≈ 194) — Student-specific validation
- **Professional Subsample** (N ≈ 274) — Workforce-specific validation

See `ANALYSIS_PLAN.md` for complete methodology and implementation details.
