# Results Directory

This directory contains analysis outputs from the AIRS psychometric validation study.

## Structure

```
results/
├── models/      # SEM model objects and saved analyses
├── plots/       # Visualizations and figures
└── tables/      # Statistical output tables
```

## Contents

### Tables (Version Controlled)
Small CSV files with statistical results are tracked for reproducibility:
- `efa_loadings.csv` - Exploratory factor analysis loadings
- `reliability_analysis.csv` - Cronbach's α, CR, AVE values

### Models (Not Tracked)
Large binary model objects are excluded from git:
- SEM model objects (`.pkl`)
- R model objects (`.rds`, `.RData`)

### Plots (Not Tracked)
Generated visualizations are excluded (regenerate from notebook):
- Factor loading plots
- Path diagrams
- Correlation heatmaps
- Distribution plots

## Regenerating Results

All results can be regenerated by running:

```bash
# Python analysis
jupyter notebook AIRS_Analysis_Python.ipynb

# R analysis (if applicable)
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('AIRS_Analysis.Rmd')"
```

## Key Outputs

### Measurement Model
- **CFI**: 0.933 (excellent fit)
- **TLI**: 0.923 (excellent fit)
- **RMSEA**: 0.065 (acceptable fit)
- **SRMR**: 0.057 (excellent fit)

### Reliability
- All UTAUT2 constructs: α > 0.70, CR > 0.70, AVE > 0.50
- Problematic constructs: VO, ER, AX (see documentation)

### Model Comparison
- Model 1 (UTAUT2): Superior fit
- Model 2 (AIRS Extended): Degraded fit due to measurement issues

**Note**: Large output files are excluded from git tracking per `.gitignore` configuration. Only CSV tables are version controlled for transparency and reproducibility.
