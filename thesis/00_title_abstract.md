## Abstract

This dissertation develops and validates the AI Readiness Scale (AIRS), an instrument measuring artificial intelligence adoption readiness among students and professionals. Extending UTAUT2 with AI-specific constructs, the study examines factors influencing behavioral intention to adopt AI tools.

Using a sample of 523 United States participants, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated an 8-factor, 16-item model with excellent fit (CFI = .975, TLI = .960, RMSEA = .065). The structural model revealed Price Value (β = .505, p < .001), Hedonic Motivation (β = .217, p = .014), and Social Influence (β = .136, p = .024) as significant predictors, explaining 85.7% of variance in behavioral intention. Traditional UTAUT predictors (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, Habit) did not significantly predict AI adoption, suggesting AI represents a distinct technology category where cost-benefit perceptions outweigh conventional utility considerations.

Four proposed constructs (Voluntariness, Explainability, Ethical Risk, AI Anxiety) were excluded due to inadequate reliability (α = .30–.58). Measurement invariance testing across student (n = 216) and professional (n = 307) populations demonstrated configural invariance. Cluster analysis identified four user segments: AI Enthusiasts (16%), Cautious Adopters (30%), Moderate Users (37%), and Anxious Avoiders (17%).

The study contributes a validated instrument for AI adoption research and establishes a foundation for future organizational applications.
