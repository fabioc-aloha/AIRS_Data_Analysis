## Abstract

This dissertation develops and validates the AI Readiness Scale (AIRS), an instrument designed to measure artificial intelligence adoption readiness. Extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) with AI-specific constructs, this study examines factors influencing behavioral intention to adopt AI tools among students and employed professionals.

Using a sample of 523 United States professionals and students, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses validated an 8-factor, 16-item model demonstrating excellent fit (CFI = .975, TLI = .960, RMSEA = .065). The structural model revealed Price Value (β = .505, p < .001), Hedonic Motivation (β = .217, p = .014), and Social Influence (β = .136, p = .024) as significant predictors of behavioral intention, while AI Trust approached but did not reach significance (β = .106, p = .064).

Four theoretically-proposed constructs (Voluntariness, Explainability, Ethical Risk, original Anxiety items) were excluded due to inadequate reliability (α = .30–.58), revealing measurement challenges with two-item scales for multi-dimensional AI constructs. Notably, traditional UTAUT predictors including Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, and Habit did not significantly predict AI adoption intention, suggesting AI tools may represent a distinct technology category where cost-benefit perceptions and enjoyment outweigh conventional utility considerations.

The study contributes a psychometrically validated instrument for AI adoption research and identifies practical implications for organizational AI implementation strategies. Findings suggest that demonstrating value relative to cost (Price Value) and fostering positive engagement experiences (Hedonic Motivation) represent the most impactful intervention targets for promoting AI adoption in higher education settings.
