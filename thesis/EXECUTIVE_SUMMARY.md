# Executive Summary

## AI Readiness Scale (AIRS): Key Findings and Contributions

### The Challenge

Organizations worldwide are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, yet research consistently shows a gap between AI adoption and realized value. Understanding what drives successful AI adoption requires validated measurement instruments that capture the psychological factors influencing technology acceptance in the AI era.

### Research Purpose

This dissertation developed and validated the **AI Readiness Scale (AIRS)**: a psychometric instrument measuring AI adoption readiness among students and employed professionals. The study extended the established UTAUT2 framework with AI-specific constructs to identify factors predicting behavioral intention to adopt AI tools.

### Key Findings

**What Drives AI Adoption?**

| Predictor | Impact | Significance |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Price Value** | β = .505 | p < .001 (Strongest predictor) |
| **Hedonic Motivation** | β = .217 | p = .014 (Second strongest) |
| **Social Influence** | β = .136 | p = .024 (Modest but significant) |
| AI Trust | β = .106 | p = .064 (Marginal) |

The model explained **86.1% of variance** in behavioral intention, exceptionally high for technology adoption research.

**Surprising Non-Findings**

Traditional UTAUT predictors that typically drive technology adoption (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, Habit) did **not** significantly predict AI adoption. This suggests AI may represent a distinct technology category where cost-benefit perceptions and engagement quality matter more than conventional utility considerations.

**Population Differences**

- Hedonic Motivation predicts adoption more strongly for students than professionals
- Professional experience strengthens the Price Value → Adoption relationship
- The scale demonstrates measurement invariance across populations, supporting cross-context applicability

**User Segments Identified**

| Segment | Size | Profile |
|---------|------|---------|
| AI Enthusiasts | 16% | High trust, high intention, low anxiety |
| Cautious Adopters | 30% | Moderate trust, evaluative stance |
| Moderate Users | 37% | Balanced profiles, pragmatic approach |
| Anxious Avoiders | 17% | High anxiety, low intention |

### Research Contributions

1. **Validated 8-factor, 16-item AIRS instrument** with excellent psychometric properties (CFI = .975, TLI = .960, RMSEA = .065)

2. **Evidence that AI adoption psychology differs from general technology adoption**, challenging assumptions that established frameworks apply directly to AI contexts

3. **Foundation for future research** on AI adoption interventions, diagnostic applications, and cross-cultural validation

### Limitations

- Cross-sectional design precludes causal inference
- Convenience sample limits generalizability
- Four proposed constructs excluded due to reliability issues, requiring refined measurement in future research

### Implications for Future Research

The validated AIRS instrument provides a foundation for:
- Longitudinal studies tracking AI adoption evolution
- Intervention research testing strategies to increase adoption
- Cross-cultural validation in diverse organizational contexts
- Diagnostic applications linking readiness profiles to adoption outcomes
