## ✅ Proposal Alignment Gaps (RESOLVED - December 7, 2025)

These gaps represented misalignments between the approved DBA proposal and current thesis deliverables. **All critical gaps have been documented in thesis chapters.**

### ✅ Critical Gaps - RESOLVED

| Gap | Proposal Promise | Resolution | Location |
|-----|------------------|------------|----------|
| **Missing Constructs** | 4 AI-specific constructs: Trust, Explainability, Ethical Risk, Anxiety | ✅ Documented: EX (α=.58), ER (α=.55), VO (α=.41), original AX (α=.30) dropped due to multi-dimensional item issues | Ch 3 §3.4.4, Ch 4 §4.2.1, Ch 5 §5.6.2 |
| **Incremental Validity (H3)** | Compare AIRS vs UTAUT2-only baseline with ΔR² | ✅ Added: UTAUT2-only AIC=148.58 vs AIRS AIC=150.59, ΔR²=.016 | Ch 4 §4.3.5 |
| **Mediation Paths (H5a-c)** | EX→TR→BI, ER→TR→BI, ER→AX→BI | ✅ Documented: Paths untestable because EX/ER dropped; noted in limitations and future research | Ch 5 §5.6.2, §5.7.1 |

### ✅ Medium Gaps - DOCUMENTED

| Gap | Proposal Promise | Resolution | Location |
|-----|------------------|------------|----------|
| **Dropped Constructs Rationale** | Document why 4 constructs excluded | ✅ Added: Reliability analysis with α values and multi-dimensionality explanation | Ch 3 §3.4.4, Ch 4 §4.2.1 |
| **Construct Exclusion Process** | Transparent reporting of psychometric decisions | ✅ Added: Full construct exclusion analysis with interpretation | Ch 4 §4.2.1 |
| **Future Research Directions** | Recommendations for dropped constructs | ✅ Added: Specific recommendations for 3-4 items per dimension, formative vs reflective models | Ch 5 §5.7.1 |

### 🟢 Justified Deviations

| Gap | Proposal | Actual | Justification |
|-----|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Price Value (PV)** | In UTAUT2 core | ✅ Included | Actually strongest predictor (β=.505) |
| **Business Unit Mod** | Moderation by BU | N/A | Single institution sample - not applicable |

### ~~Resolution Actions Required~~ ✅ COMPLETED (December 2025)

- [x] **Review EFA notebooks** - ✅ Found: EX α=.58, ER α=.55, VO α=.41, AX α=.30 (all excluded due to reliability)
- [x] **Add UTAUT2-only vs AIRS comparison** - ✅ Added to Ch 4 §4.3.5
- [x] **Clarify mediation analysis scope** - ✅ Added to Ch 5 §5.7.1 (H5a-c untestable, documented)
- [x] **Add construct exclusion rationale** - ✅ Added to Ch 3 §3.4.4 and Ch 4 §4.2.1
- [x] **CRITICAL CORRECTION** - ✅ Fixed: **Price Value β=.505 is STRONGEST** (PE β=-.028 not significant, Anxiety NOT in model)

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

| Priority | Task | Rationale | Est. Time |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| ⭐ **A** | **Resolve Proposal Gaps (above)** | Required for defense - must explain deviations | 2-3 hrs |
| **B** | **Write Chapter 1: Introduction** | Sets DBA dual-lens tone, industry benchmarks provide problem framing | 2-3 hrs |
| **C** | Complete Chapter 5: Discussion | Natural continuation from Ch 4, connects findings to theory/practice | 3-4 hrs |
| **D** | Export Figures | 15+ figures from notebooks needed, can run in parallel | 1-2 hrs |
| **E** | Review/Polish Chapter 2 | Lit review complete - may need minor refinements | 1 hr |

### Why Proposal Gaps First?

1. ⚠️ Critical alignment issues must be resolved before other chapters reference them
2. ⚠️ Chapter 1 Introduction will cite hypotheses - need consistent numbering
3. ⚠️ Chapter 5 Discussion interprets results - needs accurate construct list
4. ⚠️ Examiners will compare proposal to thesis - deviations need documentation

## 📝 Notes

### Key Statistics to Remember

- Full Sample: N=523
- EFA/CFA Split: 261/262 (seed=67)
- Role Groups: Student (216), Professional (184), Leader (123)
- Population Groups (SEM): Student (216) vs Professional+Leader (307)
- Validated Model: 8 factors, 16 items
- Model Fit: CFI=.975, TLI=.960, RMSEA=.065
- Strongest Predictor: **Price Value β=.505** (NOT Performance Expectancy)
- PE Not Significant: β=-.028, p=.791

### Novel Contributions

1. **Price Value dominance (β=.505)** - Unexpected departure from traditional UTAUT where PE dominates
2. **PE non-significant (β=-.028)** - Traditional utility may be baseline expectation for AI
3. **Experience moderation** - HM×Exp p=.007 (only HM significantly moderated)
4. **Population moderation** - HM stronger for Students (Δβ=-0.750, p=.041)
5. **4 constructs excluded** - Voluntariness, Explainability, Ethical Risk, Anxiety (α=.30-.58)

### Key Research Sources (research/ folder)

**Academic Foundation:**

| Source | Use | Key Finding |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Blut et al. (2022) UTAUT Meta-Analysis | Ch 2, 3 | 737,112 users, 1,935 samples - PE typically strongest |
| Venkatesh (2021) AI-UTAUT Agenda | Ch 2, 5 | 9 unique AI adoption challenges identified |
| AIRS Literature Review | Ch 2 | UTAUT2 + Trust theoretical justification |

**Industry Benchmarks:**

| Source | Use | Key Finding |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| McKinsey State of AI (2023-2025) | Ch 1, 5 | Adoption 55%→76%, only 1% fully mature |
| BCG AI Adoption (2024-2025) | Ch 1, 5 | 74% struggle to scale, 5% achieve ROI |
| MIT Media Lab (2025) | Ch 1 | 90-95% of GenAI pilots fail to scale |
| Capgemini (2025) | Ch 5 | Workflow redesign = 1.7× higher ROI |

### DBA Dual-Lens Integration

| Academic Lens | → | Business Lens |
|---------------|---|---------------|
| **Price Value β=.505** | → | Lead with cost-benefit and ROI messaging |
| PE non-significant | → | Utility assumed; focus on value proposition instead |
| Experience moderates HM | → | Experienced users weight enjoyment more |
| Population moderates HM | → | Students need fun; Professionals need value |
| Trust marginal (p=.064) | → | Trust-building may yield marginal gains |
| 3/7 UTAUT paths supported | → | AI may be distinct technology category |
