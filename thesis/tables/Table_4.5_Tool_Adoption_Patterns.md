## Leader Dominance Effect (Cohen's d)

| Tool Category | Leader vs. Professional | Leader vs. Academic | Interpretation |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| ChatGPT | d = 0.52 | d = 0.74 | Medium-Large |
| Microsoft Copilot | d = 0.61 | d = 0.89 | Large |
| Google Bard/Gemini | d = 0.68 | d = 0.95 | Large |
| Specialized AI | d = 0.82 | d = 1.14 | Very Large |

## Tool Usage and Behavioral Intention Correlations

| Relationship | ρ | p | Interpretation |
|-------------|---|---|----------------|
| Tool Breadth × BI | .70 | <.001 | Strong positive |
| Usage Frequency × BI | .65 | <.001 | Strong positive |
| Usage Breadth × PE | .58 | <.001 | Moderate positive |
| Usage Breadth × HM | .52 | <.001 | Moderate positive |
| Usage Breadth × AX | -.41 | <.001 | Moderate negative |

*Note: ρ = Spearman correlation; L = Leader, P = Professional, A = Academic. Post-hoc comparisons use Tukey HSD.*
