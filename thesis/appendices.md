## Appendix B: Survey Materials

### B.1 Participant Information Sheet

The online survey was administered via Centiment following institutional ethics approval. Self-selection bias was mitigated through Centiment's platform-level recruitment design: survey invitations to panel members display only the estimated completion time and reward amount, with the survey topic deliberately concealed \"in order to avoid selection bias\" (Centiment, 2024). After accessing the survey link, participants received full disclosure about the AI focus through the informed consent form, which described the study purpose, voluntary participation, data confidentiality, and right to withdraw at any time without penalty. This two-stage approach (blinded recruitment followed by informed consent) ensured ethical transparency while reducing systematic bias in participant self-selection.

### B.2 Informed Consent Form

Electronic informed consent was obtained prior to survey administration. Participants confirmed they were 18 years or older, understood the study purpose, and agreed to participate voluntarily. Consent was recorded through affirmative response before access to survey items.

### B.3 Demographic Questions

Demographic items collected included:

- **Role**: Current employment/student status (Full-time student, Part-time student, Employed - individual contributor, Employed - manager, Employed - executive, Freelancer/self-employed, Not currently employed, Other)
- **Education**: Highest level completed (High school or less, Some college/vocational, Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, Doctoral/professional degree)
- **Industry**: Primary field of work or study (Technology/IT, Healthcare, Education, Finance/Banking, Manufacturing, Government/Public sector, Retail/Hospitality, Nonprofit, Other)
- **Experience**: Years of experience in field (Less than 1 year, 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 7-10 years, 11 or more years)
- **Disability Status**: Self-disclosed (Yes, No, Prefer not to say)
- **AI Tool Usage**: Frequency of use for Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other AI tools (Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Often, Very Often)

## Appendix E: AIRS Research Roadmap and Future Applications

This appendix outlines the research program envisioned to extend the validated AIRS diagnostic instrument into practical organizational applications. The 8-factor structure already enables identification of specific adoption barriers; this roadmap represents a multi-phase research agenda to develop formalized protocols that build systematically on the foundation established in this dissertation.

### E.1 Research Program Overview

The AI Readiness Scale (AIRS) validated in this dissertation represents Phase 0 of a comprehensive research program aimed at bridging the gap between AI adoption measurement and organizational AI maturity. The 8-factor diagnostic structure was selected over a more parsimonious 7-factor model because AI Trust provides essential diagnostic capability: organizations can identify trust deficits and design targeted interventions. The roadmap below outlines subsequent research phases, each requiring independent empirical validation.

\textbf{Phase} & \textbf{Focus} & \textbf{Key Deliverables} \\
\midrule
\textbf{Phase 0} & Scale Validation & This Dissertation: 8-factor, 16-item AIRS diagnostic instrument, structural model, user typology \\
\textbf{Phase 1} & Scoring System & AIRS Score algorithm, normative benchmarks, readiness classifications \\
\textbf{Phase 2} & Organizational Diagnostics & Team/org-level assessment, gap analysis, benchmarking protocols \\
\textbf{Phase 3} & Intervention Research & Segment-specific interventions, randomized trials, effectiveness validation \\
\textbf{Phase 4} & AI Readiness Ecosystem & Longitudinal tracking, industry adaptations, practitioner certification \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5em}
\footnotesize Source: Compiled by Author
\end{table}
```

### E.2 Phase 1: AIRS Score Development

**Research Objective**: Develop a scoring methodology that transforms raw AIRS responses into interpretable individual readiness scores with established normative benchmarks.

**Key Research Questions**:

- How should construct scores be weighted to optimize predictive validity?
- What normative distributions exist across student, professional, and leadership populations?
- What classification system best communicates readiness levels to practitioners?

### E.3 Phase 2: Organizational Diagnostics

**Research Objective**: Develop validated protocols for assessing AI readiness at team and organizational levels.

**Key Research Questions**:

- What aggregation methods preserve construct validity at organizational levels?
- Do organizational readiness profiles predict AI implementation success?
- What reporting formats maximize practitioner utility?

### E.4 Phase 3: Intervention Research

**Research Objective**: Design and empirically test segment-specific interventions based on the user typology framework.

The four-segment typology identified in this dissertation (AI Enthusiasts, Cautious Adopters, Moderate Users, Anxious Avoiders) suggests that different user populations may respond to different intervention approaches. Future research should employ randomized controlled trials to test whether segment-matched interventions outperform generic approaches.

**Key Research Questions**:

- Do segment-specific interventions outperform one-size-fits-all approaches?
- What intervention components drive segment-specific effectiveness?
- Do intervention effects persist over 6-12 month follow-up periods?

### E.5 Phase 4: Comprehensive AI Readiness Ecosystem

**Research Objective**: Develop an integrated system combining validated assessment, diagnostics, and intervention protocols.

**Long-Term Vision**:

- **Longitudinal Tracking**: Systems for monitoring organizational AI readiness progression
- **Industry Adaptations**: Validated modifications for healthcare, finance, education, and manufacturing contexts
- **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Replication across collectivist cultures, developing economies, and varying policy environments
- **Practitioner Resources**: Administration guides, interpretation frameworks, and training pathways

### E.6 Contribution to the Field

This research program addresses a critical gap in the technology adoption literature: while validated measurement instruments exist, the translation of assessment into organizational action remains underdeveloped. The AIRS diagnostic structure provides the foundation for this translation by enabling identification of specific adoption barriers. By systematically building from validated diagnostic measurement through scoring, formalized protocols, intervention research, and ecosystem development, this roadmap offers a research-to-practice pipeline that can ultimately deliver the evidence-based tools organizations need to close the AI adoption-value gap.

### E.7 Collaboration and Licensing

The AIRS diagnostic instrument validated in this dissertation is made available for academic research purposes. Organizations interested in applying the AIRS framework for organizational diagnostic assessment should contact the author to discuss appropriate use, validation requirements, and potential research collaboration opportunities.

### F.2 Research Purpose and Methodology

As stated in the IRB application, the purpose of this research was to examine the psychological, motivational, and contextual factors that influence enterprise employees' readiness to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The study extended the UTAUT2 framework by adding four AI-specific constructs (trust in AI, explainability, perceived ethical risk, and AI-related anxiety) to develop and validate the Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale (AIRS).

**Research Questions**:

1. What psychological, motivational, and contextual factors influence individual readiness to adopt AI technologies within large enterprises?
2. To what extent do UTAUT2 constructs predict AI adoption readiness?

**Participant Recruitment**: Participants were recruited externally through Centiment, a professional survey research platform maintaining verified panels of adult participants across diverse industries, roles, and geographic regions. Centiment recruits panelists through social media platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn) and other outlets to achieve broad demographic representation. Critically, Centiment's recruitment methodology includes built-in self-selection bias mitigation: survey notifications to panel members display only the estimated completion time and reward amount, deliberately concealing the survey topic and subject matter "in order to avoid selection bias" (Centiment, 2024). This platform-level blinding ensured participants could not self-select based on AI interest. Target sample size was n ≈ 500 respondents.

**Risk Classification**: Exempt (minimal risk limited to potential discomfort reflecting on AI-related attitudes or privacy concerns).

### F.3 Informed Consent Statement

The following informed consent statement was presented to all participants prior to survey administration via the Centiment platform:

\midrule
\textbf{H1a} & PE $\rightarrow$ BI & Positive & -.028 & .791 & [-.234, .178] & \textbf{[X] Not Supported} \\
\textbf{H1b} & EE $\rightarrow$ BI & Positive & -.008 & .875 & [-.108, .092] & \textbf{[X] Not Supported} \\

### I.3 AI Extension Hypothesis (H2)

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Table I.4: AI Trust Extension Hypothesis (H2)}
\label{tbl:trust-result}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllllll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Hypothesis} & \textbf{Path} & \textbf{Prediction} & \textbf{$\beta$} & \textbf{p} & \textbf{95\% CI} & \textbf{Result} \\
\midrule
\textbf{H2} & TR $\rightarrow$ BI & Positive & .106 & .064 & [-.006, .218] & \textbf{[X] Marginal (Not Significant)} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5em}
\footnotesize Source: Compiled by Author
\end{table}

**Interpretation**: AI Trust approached but did not reach conventional significance (p = .064). However, the 8-factor model including AI Trust was retained as the recommended diagnostic instrument because:

1. Trust provides essential diagnostic capability for organizational assessment
2. Organizations can identify trust deficits and design targeted interventions
3. The marginal effect suggests theoretical relevance warranting further investigation with larger samples

### I.4 Moderation Hypotheses (H3–H4)

#### H3: Experience Moderation

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Table I.5: Experience Moderation Analysis (H3)}
\label{tbl:experience-moderation}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Interaction} & \textbf{Path Moderated} & \textbf{Interaction $\beta$} & \textbf{p} & \textbf{Result} \\
\midrule
PE $\times$ Experience & PE $\rightarrow$ BI & 0.112 & .055 & [!] Marginal \\
\textbf{HM $\times$ Experience} & \textbf{HM $\rightarrow$ BI} & \textbf{0.136} & \textbf{.009} & \textbf{[OK] Significant} \\
EE $\times$ Experience & EE $\rightarrow$ BI & 0.122 & .161 & [X] Not Significant \\
TR $\times$ Experience & TR $\rightarrow$ BI & 0.081 & .145 & [X] Not Significant \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5em}
\footnotesize Source: Compiled by Author
\end{table}

**H3 Result: [!] Partially Supported** – Experience significantly moderates the HM -> BI path (p = .009). Professionals with 4+ years of experience weight hedonic motivation more heavily in AI adoption decisions.

#### H4: Population Moderation

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Table I.6: Population Moderation Analysis (H4)}
\label{tbl:population-mod}
\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{@{}llllll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Path} & \textbf{Academic $\beta$} & \textbf{Professional $\beta$} & \textbf{$\Delta\beta$} & \textbf{p} & \textbf{Result} \\
\midrule
PE $\rightarrow$ BI & -0.184 & 0.084 & 0.268 & .312 & No moderation \\
EE $\rightarrow$ BI & 0.073 & -0.055 & -0.128 & .567 & No moderation \\
SI $\rightarrow$ BI & 0.007 & 0.239 & 0.232 & .284 & No moderation \\
FC $\rightarrow$ BI & -0.016 & 0.141 & 0.156 & .423 & No moderation \\
\textbf{HM $\rightarrow$ BI} & \textbf{0.449} & \textbf{-0.301} & \textbf{-0.750} & \textbf{.041} & \textbf{[OK] Significant} \\
PV $\rightarrow$ BI & 0.638 & 0.808 & 0.170 & .489 & No moderation \\
HB $\rightarrow$ BI & 0.075 & -0.064 & -0.140 & .512 & No moderation \\
TR $\rightarrow$ BI & -0.011 & 0.153 & 0.164 & .398 & No moderation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

**H4 Result: [!] Partially Supported** – Population significantly moderates HM -> BI (p = .041). Hedonic Motivation is substantially stronger for Students (β = 0.449) than Professionals (β = -0.301), indicating that enjoyment of AI tools is more important for student adoption than professional adoption.

### I.7 Constructs Not Testable

Four initially proposed AI-specific constructs demonstrated inadequate reliability during psychometric validation and could not be formally tested:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Table I.11: Constructs Not Testable Due to Reliability Issues}
\label{tbl:constructs-excluded}
\begin{tabular}{@{}>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{3cm}>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{2.5cm}lp{5cm}@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Construct} & \textbf{Cronbach's $\alpha$} & \textbf{Status} & \textbf{Recommendation} \\
\midrule
Voluntariness (VO) & .406 & Excluded & Revise operationalization \\
Explainability (EX) & .582 & Excluded & Develop AI-specific items \\
Ethical Risk (ER) & .546 & Excluded & Context-specific measurement \\
AI Anxiety (AX) & .301 & Excluded & Validated anxiety scale adaptation \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\footnotesize Source: Compiled by Author
\end{table}

These constructs remain theoretically important for AI adoption and warrant revised measurement approaches in future research.

### I.8 Key Theoretical Implications

1. **Price Value Dominance**: The finding that PV (β = .505) rather than PE drives AI adoption represents a significant theoretical departure from traditional UTAUT research, suggesting AI tools are evaluated through a value lens ("Is it worth it?") rather than a utility lens ("Will it help me?").

2. **Non-Significance of Traditional Predictors**: PE, EE, FC, and HB were not significant, suggesting AI may represent a distinct technology category requiring tailored theoretical frameworks.

3. **Experience-Dependent Mechanisms**: The experience moderation of HM suggests that adoption mechanisms differ by user characteristics in ways not previously documented in technology acceptance research.

4. **Population-Specific Pathways**: Differential HM effects across populations indicate that adoption interventions may need to be tailored to specific user groups.
