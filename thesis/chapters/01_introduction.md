# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Context

Artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved from a specialist capability to a foundational driver of enterprise transformation. Between 2023 and 2025, organizations accelerated AI integration across functions and geographies, fueled by advances in large language models, cloud-based ecosystems, and rapid democratization through enterprise platforms such as Microsoft 365 Copilot and ChatGPT Enterprise.

According to McKinsey's *State of AI* series, AI adoption has accelerated dramatically: after hovering around 50 percent for years, adoption jumped to 72 percent in 2024 and reached 88 percent by late 2025 [@mckinseyStateAI2024; @mckinseyStateAI2025]. This growth represents a fundamental shift in how organizations approach technology—AI is no longer an experimental capability but an expected component of modern work.

Yet this growth in adoption has not translated proportionally into business impact. Boston Consulting Group reported that only 5 percent of companies achieve measurable business value from AI initiatives, while roughly 74 percent struggle to scale beyond proofs of concept [@bcgAIAdoption2024; @bcgAIAdoption2025]. McKinsey found that only about 6 percent of organizations qualify as "AI high performers"—those attributing meaningful EBIT impact to AI and reporting significant value—while most organizations remain in piloting rather than scaling phases [@mckinseyStateAI2025]. IBM's Global AI Adoption Index found that 37 percent of enterprises cite data complexity and quality as their top barrier to AI success [@ibm2023], while Capgemini reports that companies embedding AI into redesigned workflows achieve 1.7 times higher ROI than those merely layering AI atop legacy processes [@capgemini2025].

These figures reveal a paradox: AI is nearly ubiquitous, yet most enterprises fail to realize sustained economic or operational returns. MIT Media Lab's NANDA initiative estimates that 90 to 95 percent of generative-AI pilots fail to scale or yield measurable profit-and-loss improvements [@mitMediaLab2025]. This persistent gap between adoption rates and value realization—termed the "adoption-value gap"—represents both a significant business challenge and a research opportunity.

Understanding why individuals adopt or resist AI tools is essential for closing this gap. While organizational-level barriers such as data infrastructure, governance frameworks, and change management have received considerable attention in practitioner literature, individual-level adoption psychology remains underexplored in empirical research. Technology acceptance research offers theoretical frameworks for understanding these individual differences, yet existing instruments were developed for earlier technology generations and may not capture the unique characteristics of AI tools.

## 1.2 Statement of the Problem

Despite decades of technology acceptance research, organizations lack validated instruments for assessing individual-level AI adoption readiness. This gap creates three interconnected problems:

**Theoretical Gap**: The dominant technology acceptance framework—the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2)—was developed and validated primarily on mobile and consumer technologies [@venkatesh2012consumer]. While UTAUT2 explains significant variance in technology adoption generally, AI tools present unique characteristics that may require theoretical extension. These include concerns about job displacement, questions of algorithmic transparency, and trust in autonomous decision-making systems. Venkatesh [-@venkatesh2021adoption] identified nine unique research challenges for AI adoption that existing frameworks do not fully address, calling for empirical investigation of AI-specific adoption factors.

**Measurement Gap**: Current AI adoption assessments in organizational practice rely largely on ad hoc surveys or general technology readiness measures. No psychometrically validated instrument exists specifically for measuring AI adoption readiness in professional and academic contexts. This measurement gap limits both research comparability and practical diagnostic utility.

**Practice Gap**: Organizations invest heavily in AI infrastructure and training but often lack the diagnostic tools to identify which employees are likely to adopt AI tools, which will resist, and why. Without valid measurement instruments, intervention strategies remain poorly targeted. The 90–95 percent pilot failure rate suggests that technology deployment without attention to individual adoption psychology produces limited returns [@mitMediaLab2025]. Deloitte reports that 60 percent of enterprises lack sufficient AI expertise for operational integration [@deloitte2024genai], while Gartner finds that more than 40 percent of AI projects face delay or cancellation due to unclear governance [@gartner2025].

## 1.3 Purpose of the Study

The purpose of this study is to develop and validate the **AI Readiness Scale (AIRS)**—a psychometrically sound instrument extending UTAUT2 for enterprise AI tool adoption. Specifically, this research aims to:

1. **Develop** a theoretically grounded measurement instrument incorporating both established UTAUT2 constructs and AI-specific factors, particularly AI Trust.

2. **Validate** the instrument through rigorous split-sample methodology, using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on a development sample and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on an independent holdout sample.

3. **Test** structural relationships between adoption predictors and behavioral intention through structural equation modeling (SEM).

4. **Examine** measurement invariance across student and professional populations to establish the instrument's applicability across diverse workforce contexts.

5. **Identify** moderating factors—including professional experience and AI usage frequency—that influence adoption pathways.

6. **Provide** organizations with a validated diagnostic tool for assessing workforce AI readiness and targeting adoption interventions.

## 1.4 Research Questions and Hypotheses

### 1.4.1 Research Questions

**Primary Research Question:**
How can UTAUT2 be extended with AI-specific constructs to better predict behavioral intention to adopt AI tools in professional and academic contexts?

**Secondary Research Questions:**

1. What is the factor structure of an AI-specific adoption readiness instrument?
2. Does the instrument demonstrate measurement invariance across student and professional populations?
3. Which factors most strongly predict behavioral intention to adopt AI tools?
4. Does AI Trust significantly predict adoption intention beyond UTAUT2 constructs?
5. What moderating factors influence the relationships between predictors and adoption intention?

### 1.4.2 Research Hypotheses

Based on UTAUT2 theory and AI-specific considerations, this study tests the following hypotheses:

**Core UTAUT2 Hypotheses (H1a–H1g)**:
- H1a–H1g: The seven UTAUT2 constructs (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, Hedonic Motivation, Price Value, and Habit) positively predict Behavioral Intention to adopt AI tools.

**AI Extension Hypothesis (H2)**:
- H2: AI Trust positively predicts Behavioral Intention beyond UTAUT2 constructs.

**Moderation Hypotheses (H3–H4)**:
- H3: Professional experience moderates the relationships between predictors and Behavioral Intention.
- H4: Population (Student vs. Professional) moderates the relationships between predictors and Behavioral Intention.

**Behavioral Validation Hypothesis (H5)**:
- H5: Behavioral Intention positively correlates with actual AI tool usage behavior.

Full hypothesis specifications with theoretical rationales are presented in Chapter 3 §3.3.2.

## 1.5 Theoretical and Practical Significance

### 1.5.1 Theoretical Significance

This study makes several contributions to technology acceptance scholarship:

**Framework Extension**: By empirically testing AI-specific constructs alongside established UTAUT2 predictors, this research extends technology acceptance theory to the AI domain. The theoretical extension responds to Venkatesh's [-@venkatesh2021adoption] call for AI-specific adoption research and addresses the unique characteristics of AI technologies that distinguish them from previous technology generations.

**Construct Validation**: The development of reliable measures for AI Trust provides validated operationalizations for future research. The psychometric validation process—including convergent validity, discriminant validity, and composite reliability assessment—ensures that these constructs meet scholarly standards for measurement quality.

**Cross-Population Invariance**: Testing measurement invariance across student and professional populations advances understanding of how adoption factors function across diverse workforce contexts. Configural invariance findings support the instrument's utility for comparative research across population segments.

**Moderation Discovery**: Identification of experience as a moderating factor on hedonic motivation pathways contributes novel insights to the technology acceptance literature, suggesting that adoption mechanisms may differ based on user characteristics in ways not previously documented.

### 1.5.2 Practical Significance

Beyond theoretical contributions, this research provides actionable tools and insights for organizations:

**Diagnostic Instrument**: The validated 16-item AIRS provides organizations with a practical tool for assessing workforce AI readiness. The instrument's brevity (approximately 5 minutes to complete) enables deployment at scale while maintaining psychometric rigor.

**Intervention Targeting**: The four-segment user typology identified through cluster analysis—AI Enthusiasts (16%), Cautious Adopters (30%), Moderate Users (37%), and Anxious Avoiders (17%)—provides actionable categories for targeted intervention design. Each segment requires different change management approaches.

**Evidence-Based Messaging**: The finding that Price Value (β = .505) dominates adoption intention—rather than traditional performance messaging—suggests organizations should emphasize cost-benefit value propositions in AI adoption communications.

**Experience-Tailored Training**: The moderating effect of professional experience on hedonic motivation pathways indicates that experienced professionals may require different engagement strategies than early-career employees.

## 1.6 Scope and Delimitations

### 1.6.1 Scope

This study focuses on individual-level adoption of AI tools in professional and academic contexts. The research:

- **Examines** behavioral intention to adopt AI tools as the primary outcome variable, with actual tool usage as a behavioral validation criterion.
- **Encompasses** both students and employed professionals across multiple industries, providing cross-population generalizability testing.
- **Includes** common AI tools such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini as the technology context.
- **Applies** established psychometric validation methodology including split-sample EFA/CFA, structural equation modeling, and measurement invariance testing.
- **Addresses** adoption predictors at the individual psychological level rather than organizational or technological levels.

### 1.6.2 Delimitations

The following boundaries define what this study does not address:

**Organizational Factors**: While organizational infrastructure undoubtedly influences AI adoption, this study focuses on individual-level psychological predictors rather than organizational readiness factors such as IT infrastructure, leadership support, or governance frameworks.

**Actual Behavior Prediction**: The primary outcome is behavioral intention rather than sustained behavioral change. While intention strongly correlates with self-reported usage (ρ = .69), the study does not track actual usage behavior over time.

**Specific AI Tool Comparison**: The study examines AI tool adoption generally rather than comparing adoption patterns across specific tools (e.g., ChatGPT vs. Copilot).

**Cultural Context**: Data collection occurred in a single national context (primarily United States respondents). Cross-cultural generalizability requires future investigation.

**Dropped Constructs**: Four initially proposed AI-specific constructs—Voluntariness (α = .406), Explainability (α = .582), Ethical Risk (α = .546), and AI Anxiety (α = .301)—demonstrated inadequate reliability and were excluded from the validated model. These constructs remain theoretically important but require revised operationalization in future research.
