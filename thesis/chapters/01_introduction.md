## 1.4 Research Questions and Hypotheses

### 1.4.1 Research Questions

**Primary Research Question:**
How can UTAUT2 be extended with AI-specific constructs to better predict behavioral intention to adopt AI tools in professional and academic contexts?

**Secondary Research Questions:**

1. What is the factor structure of an AI-specific adoption readiness instrument?
2. Does the instrument demonstrate measurement invariance across student and professional populations?
3. Which factors most strongly predict behavioral intention to adopt AI tools?
4. Does AI Trust significantly predict adoption intention beyond UTAUT2 constructs?
5. What moderating factors influence the relationships between predictors and adoption intention?

## 1.8 Summary and Dissertation Structure

This chapter has introduced the research problem, purpose, questions, and significance of this study examining AI adoption readiness in professional and academic contexts.

The dissertation is organized into six chapters:

**Chapter 1: Introduction** establishes the research context, problem statement, research questions, and significance of the study.

**Chapter 2: Literature Review** examines the evolution of technology acceptance models from TAM through UTAUT2, synthesizes AI-specific adoption research, and develops the conceptual framework for the study.

**Chapter 3: Research Methodology** describes the research design, sampling procedures, instrument development, and analytical strategy employed in the ten-phase validation approach.

**Chapter 4: Findings** presents the empirical results from exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, measurement invariance testing, structural equation modeling, and behavioral validation.

**Chapter 5: Analysis and Discussion** interprets the findings in relation to existing literature, discusses theoretical and practical implications, and addresses unexpected findings.

**Chapter 6: Conclusions, Implications, and Recommendations** summarizes the study's contributions, provides recommendations for practitioners and organizations, acknowledges limitations, and suggests directions for future research.
