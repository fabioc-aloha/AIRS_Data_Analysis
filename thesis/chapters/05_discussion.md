# Chapter 5: Discussion and Conclusions

## 5.1 Introduction

This chapter discusses the implications of the AIRS validation study findings, addresses limitations, and provides recommendations for future research and practice.

## 5.2 Summary of Key Findings

### 5.2.1 AIRS Instrument Validation
The study successfully validated an 8-factor, 16-item AI Readiness Scale extending UTAUT2 with AI Trust.

### 5.2.2 Supported Relationships
Three of seven UTAUT2 paths were significant:
- **Social Influence** (β = .136): Peer influence matters for AI adoption
- **Hedonic Motivation** (β = .217): Enjoyment drives adoption
- **Price Value** (β = .505): Cost-benefit analysis is paramount

### 5.2.3 AI Trust Extension
AI Trust approached significance (β = .106, p = .064), providing tentative support for the theoretical extension.

## 5.3 Discussion of Findings

### 5.3.1 Price Value as Strongest Predictor

**Finding**: PV unexpectedly emerged as the strongest predictor (β = .505).

**Interpretation**:

### 5.3.2 Non-Significant UTAUT2 Paths

**Finding**: PE, EE, FC, and HB were not significant predictors.

**Interpretation**:

### 5.3.3 AI Trust Marginality

**Finding**: TR approached but did not reach significance (p = .064).

**Interpretation**:
[To be written - discuss power considerations, trust as emerging construct]

### 5.3.4 Experience as Novel Moderator

**Finding**: Professional experience strengthens PE→BI and HM→BI.

**Interpretation**:

### 5.3.5 User Typology Segments

**Finding**: Four distinct user segments identified.

**Implications for Practice**:
- AI Enthusiasts (16%): Leverage as champions
- Cautious Adopters (30%): Address concerns while maintaining engagement
- Moderate Users (37%): Benefit-focused messaging
- Anxious Avoiders (17%): Targeted anxiety-reduction interventions

### 5.3.6 Disability and Accessibility

**Finding**: Disability associated with higher AI anxiety (d = .36).

**Implications**:

## 5.4 Theoretical Contributions

1. **UTAUT2 Extension**: Validated AI Trust as potential extension
2. **Context-Specific Model**: Identified AI-specific adoption drivers
3. **Career Development Integration**: Experience as novel moderator
4. **User Typology Framework**: Practical segmentation approach

## 5.5 Practical Implications

### 5.5.1 For Organizations

## 5.6 Limitations

1. **Cross-sectional design**: Cannot establish causality
2. **Self-reported intention**: May not reflect actual behavior
3. **Convenience sampling**: Limits generalizability
4. **Dropped constructs**: Four AI-specific constructs required redesign
5. **Marginal AI Trust**: p = .064 requires replication
6. **Western sample**: Cultural generalizability unknown

## 5.7 Future Research Directions

### 5.7.1 Immediate Priorities
1. Replicate with larger sample to improve power for AI Trust
2. Redesign dropped construct items
3. Longitudinal study of intention-behavior relationship

### 5.7.2 Extended Research Agenda
1. Cross-cultural validation
2. Industry-specific applications
3. Intervention studies based on user typology
4. Accessibility-focused AI anxiety research
