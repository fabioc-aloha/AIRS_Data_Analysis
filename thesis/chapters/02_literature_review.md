## 2.8 Research Hypotheses

### Core UTAUT2 Hypotheses (H1a-H1g)
- **H1a**: Performance Expectancy positively predicts Behavioral Intention
- **H1b**: Effort Expectancy positively predicts Behavioral Intention
- **H1c**: Social Influence positively predicts Behavioral Intention
- **H1d**: Facilitating Conditions positively predicts Behavioral Intention
- **H1e**: Hedonic Motivation positively predicts Behavioral Intention
- **H1f**: Price Value positively predicts Behavioral Intention
- **H1g**: Habit positively predicts Behavioral Intention

### AI Trust Extension (H2)
- **H2**: AI Trust positively predicts Behavioral Intention

### Population Differences (H3)
- **H3**: Structural relationships differ between academic and professional populations

### Moderation Hypotheses (H4a-H4f)
- **H4a-f**: Various moderators affect predictor-intention relationships

### Mediation Hypotheses (H5a-H5c)
- **H5a-c**: Trust mediates relationships between AI-specific constructs and intention
