# DBA Dissertation Structure

A Doctor of Business Administration dissertation must demonstrate mastery of scholarly inquiry and the ability to generate practical insights that improve organizational decision making. The structure below integrates methodological rigor, theoretical contribution, and applied value, consistent with guidance for professional doctorates (Creswell & Creswell, 2018; Saunders et al., 2019).

## Chapter 1: Introduction

**Typical length: 15 to 25 pages**

Purpose: Establish the research problem, justify the significance, and orient the reader to the study’s structure.

**Recommended sub-sections:**

1. Background and Context of the Study
2. Statement of the Problem
3. Purpose of the Study
4. Research Questions and Hypotheses
5. Theoretical and Practical Significance
6. Scope and Delimitations
7. Definition of Key Terms
8. Summary of Chapter and Dissertation Structure

This aligns with doctoral standards requiring clear articulation of the research gap and rationale (Creswell & Creswell, 2018).

---

## Chapter 2: Literature Review

**Typical length: 40 to 60 pages**

Purpose: Demonstrate command of the scholarly landscape, identify gaps, and position the study within the theoretical domain.

**Recommended sub-sections:**

1. Overview of the Topic Area
2. Historical and Contemporary Perspectives
3. Critical Review of Theoretical Models
4. Integration of Professional and Practitioner Literature
5. Synthesis of Empirical Evidence
6. Identification of Gaps and Limitations in Prior Research
7. Conceptual Framework for the Study

This structure aligns with expectations that DBA dissertations bridge academic and practice-based literature (Saunders et al., 2019).

---

## Chapter 3: Methodology

**Typical length: 25 to 40 pages**

Purpose: Provide a transparent, reproducible roadmap for how the research was conducted.

**Recommended sub-sections:**

1. Research Paradigm and Design
2. Rationale for Qualitative, Quantitative, or Mixed Methods
3. Population and Sampling Approach
4. Data Collection Procedures
5. Instrumentation and Measures
6. Data Analysis Strategy
7. Validity, Reliability, and Trustworthiness
8. Ethical Considerations
9. Pilot Testing or Pre-Testing Procedures (if applicable)

Professional doctorates require strong methodological justification and transparency (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2017).

---

## Chapter 4: Findings

**Typical length: 35 to 70 pages**

Purpose: Present empirical results clearly and systematically without interpretation.

**Recommended sub-sections:**

1. Description of the Sample
2. Data Screening and Preparation
3. Presentation of Quantitative or Qualitative Results
4. Tables, Figures, and Visual Summaries
5. Findings Organized by Research Question

Separating results from interpretation increases clarity and rigor (Yin, 2018).

---

## Chapter 5: Analysis and Discussion

**Typical length: 20 to 40 pages**

Purpose: Interpret findings, connect them to the literature, and explain theoretical and practical meaning.

**Recommended sub-sections:**

1. Interpretation of Findings
2. Comparison with Existing Literature
3. Implications for Theory
4. Implications for Practice and Organizational Decision Making
5. Unexpected Findings and Study Limitations

This is where scholarly contribution and business relevance are integrated.

---

## Chapter 6: Conclusions, Implications, and Recommendations

**Typical length: 10 to 20 pages**

Purpose: Summarize the study and show its long-term impact.

**Recommended sub-sections:**

1. Summary of Purpose, Methods, and Key Findings
2. Theoretical Contributions
3. Practical and Managerial Implications
4. Recommendations for Organizations and Practitioners
5. Limitations of the Study
6. Recommendations for Future Research
7. Closing Remarks

This chapter demonstrates both academic insight and applied value, which is central to the DBA.

## Appendices

**Typical length: varies**

Examples include:
Survey instruments
Interview guides
IRB materials
Data tables
Coding schemes
Statistical outputs
Figures too detailed for the main text

# Summary of Improvements Made

Compared to your original structure, this updated version:

• Strengthens clarity in chapter purposes
• Adds missing components such as definitions of terms, delimitations, pilot testing, and data screening
• Reflects best practice in separating findings from interpretation
• Integrates both scholarly and practitioner contributions more explicitly
• Aligns more tightly with standards for applied doctorate methodology and contribution
